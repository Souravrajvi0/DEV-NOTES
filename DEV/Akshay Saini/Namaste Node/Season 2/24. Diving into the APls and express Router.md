Grouping APIs and creating separate routers for them is a best practice in software development for several reasons:

1. **Modularity**: Organizing APIs into distinct routers makes the codebase more modular. Each router can handle a specific set of functionalities, making it easier to manage and understand.
    
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Different routers can be dedicated to different aspects of the application (e.g., authentication, user profiles, connection requests). This separation helps in maintaining the code and reduces complexity.
    
3. **Scalability**: As the application grows, having separate routers allows developers to scale different parts of the application independently. New features can be added to specific routers without affecting others.
    
4. **Maintainability**: It’s easier to maintain and update code when related functionalities are grouped together. Changes to one router are less likely to inadvertently affect another.
    
5. **Readability**: Code that is organized into routers is generally more readable. Developers can quickly find the relevant API endpoints and understand their purpose.
    
6. **Testing**: Isolating different parts of the API makes it easier to write unit tests and integration tests for specific functionalities without needing to test the entire application.
    
7. **Middleware Usage**: Different routers can have different middleware applied to them, allowing for more granular control over things like authentication, logging, and error handling.
    
8. **Performance**: By grouping APIs logically, it can lead to performance optimizations, such as caching strategies that can be applied to certain routes without impacting others.
    

Overall, this approach promotes cleaner architecture and enhances the overall development experience

**Yes, naming your APIs effectively can significantly aid in categorizing them under the appropriate routers and clarifying their functionality.**
1. **Descriptive Names**: API names should be descriptive enough to convey their purpose. For example, an endpoint like `POST /user/signup` clearly indicates that it is used for user registration.
    
2. **Consistency**: Using a consistent naming convention helps developers quickly understand the structure of the API. For instance, if all user-related endpoints start with `/user`, it’s easier to categorize them under a `userRouter`.
    
3. **Action-Oriented**: Including the action in the name (e.g., `create`, `update`, `delete`, `view`) helps clarify what the endpoint does. For example, `GET /user/profile` suggests retrieving user profile information.
    
4. **Resource Identification**: Clearly identifying resources in the endpoint path helps in understanding the data being manipulated. For example, `POST /request/send/interested/:userId` indicates that it deals with sending a connection request to a specific user.
    
5. **Categorization**: By structuring names logically, you can easily group related APIs. For example, all endpoints related to authentication can be prefixed with `auth`, helping to categorize them under an `authRouter`.
    
6. **Versioning**: Including versioning in the API name (e.g., `/v1/user/login`) can help in managing changes over time and ensuring backward compatibility.
    
7. **Error Handling**: Clear names can also assist in error handling and debugging, making it easier to identify which endpoint may be causing issues based on the name.

**MY APP.JS SHOULD BE CLEAN AS FUCK**

## **EXPRESS ROUTER**

In **Express.js**, a **router** is a mechanism used to handle different HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for specific endpoints (URIs) and direct them to appropriate logic (controllers or middleware functions). The router acts as a mini or modular "sub-application" that helps in organizing routes for specific parts of your application.
### Key Aspects of an Express Router:

1. **Routing Organization**:
    
    - Instead of defining all routes in the main application file (`app.js` or `server.js`), you can use an Express router to organize routes by grouping related routes into modules. This keeps your code cleaner and more modular.
2. **Modularity**:
    
    - Routers in Express allow you to divide your routing logic into separate files. For instance, you might have routes for users, products, and orders, each in their own file, which then gets imported into the main app file.
3. **Middleware Integration**:
    
    - Routers also support the use of **middleware**. Middleware functions can be specific to a router, and they are executed before the request is passed to the route handler.

### Example: Basic Router Setup in Express


```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router(); // Create a new router

// Define routes on the router

// GET route for "/users"
router.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of users');
});

// POST route for "/users"
router.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('User created');
});

module.exports = router; // Export the router

```

### Example: Using the Router in the Main App


```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRouter = require('./routes/users'); // Import the router

// Use the router in your app
app.use('/api', userRouter);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```


In this example:

- `app.use('/api', userRouter)`: Mounts the router on the `/api` path, so routes inside `userRouter` will be accessed at `/api/users` (e.g., `GET /api/users`).

### Key Features of Express Router:

1. **Method-based Routing**: Supports routing based on HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.).
    
    - Example: `router.get()`, `router.post()`, etc.
2. **Middleware**: Routers can apply middleware, either globally to all routes or specifically to certain ones.
    
    - Example: Logging, authentication, or validation middleware.
3. **Parameter Handling**: Express routers support parameters in routes for handling dynamic URLs.
    
    - Example: `router.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {...})`
4. **Modularity**: Allows for better separation of concerns by dividing route logic into separate files.

->In Express.js, when you import routers and use `app.use("/")` (or any specific route) to mount them, you're essentially organizing your application’s routing in a modular way. This allows you to separate different parts of your application's routes into distinct files or modules, enhancing maintainability and readability.

**Import the Router in Your Main Application File**: In your main application file (e.g., `app.js`), you import the router you created.


```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRouter = require('./userRouter'); // Import the user router

// Use the router for the "/users" route
app.use('/users', userRouter); // Mount the userRouter on the "/users" path

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Explanation of `app.use("/")`

- **`app.use('/users', userRouter)`**: This line of code mounts the `userRouter` at the `/users` route. This means that any requests to `/users` will be handled by the routes defined in `userRouter`.

### How It Works

- **Path Prefixing**: By using `app.use('/users', userRouter)`, all routes defined in `userRouter` will automatically be prefixed with `/users`.
    
    - For example, if a user accesses `/users`, they will hit the route defined by `router.get('/', ...)` in `userRouter`.
    - If a user accesses `/users/profile`, they will hit the route defined by `router.get('/profile', ...)`.
- **Modularity**: This structure allows you to keep related routes together. In a larger application, you can have separate routers for different resources (e.g., `userRouter`, `productRouter`, `orderRouter`, etc.), which makes your codebase more organized.

### Additional Use Cases for `app.use()`

- **Middleware**: You can also use `app.use()` to apply middleware functions to specific routes or to the entire application.
```javascript
const authRouter=require("./routes/auth.js");
const profileRouter=require("./routes/profile.js");
const requestRouter=require("./routes/request.js");
app.use("/",authRouter);
app.use("/",profileRouter);
app.use("/",requestRouter);
```

# HOW TO WRITE API'S 

When you call an API and a cookie is sent from the server, the cookie can be sent back to the client (the browser or any HTTP client) for subsequent requests. Here's how the process typically works:

### 1.**Client Makes an API Request**

- When the client (such as a web browser or an application) makes an API request to the server, it may include cookies that it has stored from previous interactions with the server.
- For example, when you log in to a website, the server may send a cookie that contains session information or an authentication token.

### 2. **Server Processes the Request**

- Upon receiving the request, the server can read any cookies sent by the client. It processes the request based on the information contained in those cookies.
- The server may perform actions like validating the user's session or checking permissions based on the cookie data.

### 3. **Server Sends a Response with a Cookie**

- The server can send a response back to the client, which may include new cookies or modifications to existing ones.
- For example, the server might send an authentication token as a cookie or update the expiration time of a session cookie.

**LOGOUT API**
### 1. Using `res.clearCookie("token")`

- **Purpose**: This method is specifically designed to clear a cookie. It sets the cookie's expiration date to a time in the past, effectively instructing the browser to delete it.
    
- **Usage**
    `res.clearCookie("token");`
    
- **Advantages**:
    
    - **Simplicity**: It's straightforward and conveys the intent clearly — you want to remove the cookie.
    - **Less Error-Prone**: You don't need to manage the expiration date yourself, and it automatically handles any required attributes (like the path or domain) associated with the cookie.
### Setting the Cookie to `null` with an Expiration Date

- **Purpose**: This approach sets the cookie value to `null` and provides an expiration date that is in the past, effectively instructing the browser to delete it.
    
- **Usage**:
    `res.cookie("token", null, {     expires: new Date(Date.now()), // Expiration date in the past });`
    
- **Advantages**:
    
    - **Explicit Control**: You can set additional options for the cookie (like `path`, `domain`, etc.), which may be useful in specific scenarios.
    - **Flexibility**: If you need to customize other attributes when clearing the cookie, this method gives you that capability.

### Which One is Better?

- **Best Practice**: In most cases, **`res.clearCookie("token")`** is the better option


WE CAN ALSO CHAIN THINGS IN EXPRESS
```javascript
res.cookie("token",null,{
        expires:new Date(Date.now()),
    }).send("Logout Sucessfully");
```

PROFILE EDIT API


```javascript
profileRouter.patch("/profile/edit",userAuth,async (req,res) => {
      try{
        const data=req.body;
        const ALLOWED_UPDATES=[
            "photourl","about","url","gender","about","skills","password"
          ]
       const isUpdateAllowed=Object.keys(data).every(k =>ALLOWED_UPDATES.includes(k));
          if(!isUpdateAllowed){
            throw new Error("Update Not allowed");
          }
        // if(data?.skills.length>100){
        //     throw new Error("skills can't be more than 10");
        //   }
          console.log(req.user._id.toString());
          await User.findByIdAndUpdate({_id:req.user._id.toString()},data);
       

          res.send("User Updated Sucessfully");
        

    }catch(error){
        res.status(400).send("Something went wrong "+error.message);
    }
```
