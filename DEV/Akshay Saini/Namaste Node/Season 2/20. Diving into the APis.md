### 1. Definition

- **JavaScript Object**:
    
    - A JavaScript object is a complex data type that can hold multiple values in the form of key-value pairs. It is used to represent real-world entities and can include functions, methods, and other objects.
    - **Example**:
   
```javascript
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    isEmployed: true,
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    },
   };
```

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**:
    
    - JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a text format that is completely language-independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages (including JavaScript).
    - JSON can only represent data and does not support functions or methods.
    - **Example**:
        
    
```json
    {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "isEmployed": true // end mein coma nahi chahiye json mein
    }

```
### 2. Syntax

- **JavaScript Object**:
    
    - Uses a more flexible syntax. Keys can be strings (with or without quotes), numbers, or symbols, and values can be of any data type, including functions.
**JSON**:

- Must use double quotes for keys and string values. It does not support functions, comments, or trailing commas.

### 3. Use Cases

- **JavaScript Object**:
    
    - Used in JavaScript code to store and manipulate data, create complex data structures, and build applications.
    - You can call methods on JavaScript objects and use them in your logic.
- **JSON**:
    
    - Primarily used for data interchange between a server and a client or between different systems. It’s often used in APIs to send data in a structured format.
    - JSON is commonly used to serialize and transmit structured data over a network connection.

### 4. Conversion

- **JavaScript Object**:
    
    - You can easily manipulate and interact with JavaScript objects directly in your code.
- **JSON**:
    
    - To use JSON in JavaScript, you often need to convert it into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()` and convert a JavaScript object back to JSON format using `JSON.stringify()`.


-> Now if we send a json object with a post request and when we try to print the request Body in the post method route handler it will print undefined!
-> When you send a JSON object in a POST request and try to print the request body in the route handler but it prints `undefined`, this usually happens because **Express.js** (the web framework often used in Node.js) doesn’t automatically parse the incoming request body as JSON.
### Why Does It Print `undefined`?

By default, Express does not know how to handle the incoming data format, and thus, the body is `undefined`. This is because:

1. When a client sends data (like a JSON object) in the body of a POST request, the server needs to **explicitly parse** that data to use it.
2. In Express, **middleware** is required to parse the body of incoming requests. Without this middleware, Express won’t automatically understand how to handle the JSON or form data that you send in the body.

### The Solution: Use `express.json()` Middleware

To parse incoming JSON data and avoid the `undefined` issue, you need to use the `express.json()` middleware in your Express application. This middleware tells Express to automatically parse the request body as JSON when the content type is `application/json`.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse incoming JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/your-route', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body);  // This will now print the JSON object sent in the request body
    res.send('Data received');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

```


### Why It Works:

- **`express.json()`**: This middleware parses the incoming request body if it’s JSON, meaning it turns the body from a string format (which is how it's sent over HTTP) into a JavaScript object, allowing you to access it via `req.body`.

`express.json()` is similar to `JSON.parse()`, but it’s more specialized for Express and HTTP requests.

Here’s how they’re similar and different:

### Similarities:

- **Purpose**: Both `express.json()` and `JSON.parse()` are used to convert JSON strings into JavaScript objects.
- **Result**: After parsing, they both produce a JavaScript object that can be used in the application.
### Differences:

1. **Context**:
    
    - `express.json()` is a middleware function in Express specifically designed to parse JSON payloads from incoming HTTP requests.
    - `JSON.parse()` is a JavaScript function that can convert any JSON string to a JavaScript object. It’s not specific to Express or HTTP requests.
  **2.Error Handling**:

- `express.json()` includes built-in error handling. If the JSON payload is malformed, it responds with a `400 Bad Request` error automatically.
- `JSON.parse()` will throw an error if it encounters malformed JSON, but there’s no automatic error handling, so you’d need to catch and handle this error yourself.
**3.Usage in Request Handling**:
 - express.json() automatically parses the JSON in the HTTP request body when Content-Type is application/json, so you don’t need to handle the raw JSON string manually. 
 - Without express.json(), you’d have to manually read and parse the raw request data using JSON.parse(), which can be more cumbersome
### How `app.use(express.json())` Works

- **`express.json()`** is built-in middleware that parses incoming JSON requests and populates `req.body`. It automatically calls `next()` when it’s done parsing, so you don’t need to worry about it.

AB NEXT TIME HAR API METHOD SE RELATED JO FUCNTION HAI MOONGOOSE LIBRARY MEIN VO BHI PADH LENA!
## 1 POST  API  
To make an api where we can receive data from outside the server!
```javascript
app.use(express.json());
app.post("/signup", async(req,res)=>{
  const user= new User(req.body);
  try{
    await user.save();
    res.send("User added  successfully")
     }catch(error){
      res.status(500),send("ERROR AGYA BHAI");
    }
  });

```

## 2.GET API

More like the feed API, saari profiles dekhi hai mujhe!

NOW THE MAIN THING WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW TO GET DATA FROM THE DATABASE???
SO WHENEVER WE'VE TO GET SOMETHING FROM THE DATABASE WE HAVE TO KNOW WHICH MODEL TO USE!

API TO FIND ONE USER FROM THE DATABASE! BASED ON THE EMAIL

**GOLDEN RULE-> WHENEVER I'M DOING A DB OPERATION ALWAYS USE ASYNC/AWAIT**, **AND DO THESE TRANSACTIONS IN TRY AND CATCH BLOCK**


```javascript
app.get("/user",async(req,res)=>{
const userEmail=req.body.emailId;
try{
const user= await User.find({emailId:userEmail});
if(user)
 res.send(user);
}catch(error){
res.status(400).send(" SOMETHING WENT WRONG");
}
})
```


OUTPUT RESPONSE OF THIS IS AN ARRAY CONTAING ALL THOSE OBJECTS/DOCUMENTS THAT HAS THE SAME EMAIL ID THAT WAS INITIALLY PASSED WITH THE URL
```javascript
[
    {
        "_id": "67124f5a8d84a27594d04659",
        "firstName": "Sourav",
        "lastName": "Rajvi",
        "password": "sourav123",
        "age": 24,
        "emailId": "souravrajvi18@gmail.com",
        "gender": "male",
        "__v": 0
    },
    {
        "_id": "6712613d0b70063220ac8611",
        "firstName": "Sourav",
        "lastName": "Rajvi",
        "password": "sourav123",
        "age": 24,
        "emailId": "souravrajvi18@gmail.com",
        "gender": "male",
        "__v": 0
    }
]
```
**`await User.find({ emailId: userEmail });`** RETURNS AN ARRAY OF OBJECTS!

-> Now If the email doesn't match into the all the emails that are present in the database then it return an empty array!

NOW WHAT IF WE HAVE TO FIND ALL THE USERS IN THAT CASE!


HERE WE JUST SEND AN EMPTY OBJECT THAT'S ABOUT IT!
```javascript
app.get("/feed",async(req,res)=>{
  try{
    const users=await User.find({});
    res.send(users);
  }catch(error){
    res.status(500).send("SOMETHING WENT WRONG2");
  }

})
```

In MongoDB, `model.find()` and `model.findOne()` are methods used to query documents in a collection.
### 1. **`model.find()`**:

- **Purpose**: It retrieves **multiple** documents that match the query criteria.
- **Return Value**: It returns an **array** of all matching documents.
- **Usage**:
    

    
    `model.find({ name: "John" });`
    
    This query will return an array of all documents where the name is "John".
- **Example Result**:
    
  
    
    `[   { "_id": 1, "name": "John", "age": 25 },   { "_id": 2, "name": "John", "age": 30 } ]`
    

### 2. **`model.findOne()`**:

- **Purpose**: It retrieves **only the first** document that matches the query criteria.
- **Return Value**: It returns a **single document** (or `null` if no match is found).
- **Usage**:
    
    
    `model.findOne({ name: "John" });`
    
    This query will return the first document where the name is "John".
- **Example Result**:
    
    
    
    `{ "_id": 1, "name": "John", "age": 25 }`
    

### Key Differences:

- **`find()`** returns an array of all matching documents.
- **`findOne()`** returns just the first matching document.

When using `model.findOne()` and multiple documents match the query criteria, MongoDB will return the **first document** that matches according to the **natural order** in which the documents are stored in the database.

### What determines which document is returned?

1. **Natural Order**:
    
    - MongoDB stores documents in the order they were inserted, so the "first" document usually refers to the one that was inserted earliest.
    - However, this order can change if documents are updated, deleted, or the collection is compacted.
2. **No Guarantee**:
    
    - There is **no strict guarantee** on which specific document will be returned if you have multiple documents with the same values. If you need to control the returned document, it's best to use `.findOne()` with a sorting option.

In MongoDB, you can apply multiple conditions to `find()` or `findOne()` by passing an object with multiple key-value pairs representing the conditions. MongoDB will treat these conditions as an **AND** operation by default, meaning that all conditions must be met for a document to be returned.

### Syntax for Applying Multiple Conditions

You can include multiple fields in your query like this:

### Example using `find()`:



`model.find({ name: "John", age: 30 });`

- This will return all documents where the `name` is "John" **and** the `age` is 30.

### Example using `findOne()`:



`model.findOne({ name: "John", age: 30 });`

- This will return the first document where `name` is "John" **and** `age` is 30.

### Logical Operators for Complex Queries

MongoDB also supports various logical operators like **`$or`**, **`$and`**, **`$gt`**, **`$lt`**, and more for more complex queries.

#### Example: Using `$and` (although implicit, you can specify it explicitly)



`model.find({   $and: [     { name: "John" },     { age: { $gt: 25 } }   ] });`

- This will return all documents where `name` is "John" **and** `age` is greater than 25.

#### Example: Using `$or` (either condition must be met)



`model.find({   $or: [     { name: "John" },     { age: { $lt: 30 } }   ] });`

- This will return all documents where either the `name` is "John" **or** the `age` is less than 30.

#### Example: Combining `$or` with `$and`


`model.find({   $and: [     { age: { $gt: 25 } },     {       $or: [         { name: "John" },         { name: "Doe" }       ]     }   ] });`

- This query returns documents where `age` is greater than 25, **and** the `name` is either "John" **or** "Doe".

### Operators for Matching Specific Conditions:

- **$gt (greater than)**:
    
    
    
    `{ age: { $gt: 30 } }`
    
- **$lt (less than)**:
    
    
    
    `{ age: { $lt: 30 } }`
    
- **$gte (greater than or equal)**:
    

    
    `{ age: { $gte: 30 } }`
    
- **$lte (less than or equal)**:
    
    
    `{ age: { $lte: 30 } }`


## 3. DELETE API

YE JITNE BHI FUNCTIONS HOTE HAI NA UNMEIN FILTER OBJECTS PASS HOTE HAIN!
When you pass a **filter object** inside `find()` or `findOne()` in MongoDB, the function will return documents that match the conditions specified by that filter object. Here's a breakdown of how the matching works:

### Basic Filter Object Matching

1. **Field and Value Pairs**:
    
    - **The filter object consists of key-value pairs where the key is the field in the document, and the value is the condition you want to match.**
    
    For example:
    
    
    
    `model.find({ name: "John", age: 30 });`
    
    - **Key**: `name`, `age` (field names in the document).
    - **Value**: `"John"`, `30` (the value you are trying to match).
    
    This query will match documents where:
    
    - The `name` field is `"John"`.
    - The `age` field is `30`.

### Matching Logic

- **Equality Match (Default Behavior)**: By default, MongoDB checks for **exact equality** when you pass a simple key-value pair. So:
    
    
    
    `{ name: "John" }`
    
    Will match documents where the `name` field exactly equals `"John"`.
    
- **Logical AND (Default Behavior)**: When you pass multiple key-value pairs in the same filter object, MongoDB will treat them as **AND** conditions. The document must satisfy **all** conditions to be considered a match.
    
    
    `{ name: "John", age: 30 }`
    
    The document must have both `name` as `"John"` **and** `age` as `30` to match.
    

### Advanced Matching with Operators

- **Comparison Operators**: You can use MongoDB operators like `$gt`, `$lt`, `$in`, etc., to perform more complex matches.
    
    Example:
    
    
    `{ age: { $gt: 25 } }`
    
    This will match documents where `age` is greater than 25.
    
- **Logical Operators**: You can combine multiple conditions with logical operators like `$and`, `$or`, and `$not`.
    
    Example of `$or`:
    
 
    
    `{ $or: [{ name: "John" }, { age: 30 }] }`
    
    This will match documents where either `name` is `"John"` **or** `age` is `30`.
    

### Example: What Should the Document Match?

Given this query:



`model.find({   name: "John",   age: { $gt: 25 },   city: "New York" });`

This filter object says the document must:

1. Have a `name` field with the value `"John"`.
2. Have an `age` field with a value **greater than** 25.
3. Have a `city` field with the value `"New York"`.

Only documents that match **all** these conditions will be returned.


```javascript
app.delete("/user",async(req,res)=>{
  const userId=req.body.userId;
  try{
    await User.findByIdAndDelete({_id:userId});
    res.send("User Deleted Sucessfully");
  }catch(error){
    res.status(500).send("Something went wrong3");
  }
})
```

## 4. Patch API

The `PATCH` and `PUT` methods are both used for updating resources in HTTP, but they differ in how they handle updates and the scope of the changes. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. **`PUT` Method:**

- **Purpose**: The `PUT` method is used to **replace** an existing resource or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
- **Behavior**: It requires the client to send the **entire updated object**, even if only a part of it has changed.
- **Idempotence**: `PUT` is **idempotent**, meaning making the same `PUT` request multiple times will result in the same resource state.
- **Use Case**: When you want to replace a resource completely or update all fields of a resource

### 2. **`PATCH` Method:**

- **Purpose**: The `PATCH` method is used to **partially update** an existing resource, meaning you can send only the fields that need to be changed.
- **Behavior**: It modifies the resource with the provided updates without replacing the entire object.
- **Idempotence**: `PATCH` is generally idempotent (if you make the same request multiple times, the resource remains the same), but it depends on implementation.
- **Use Case**: When you want to update **only part of a resource** without sending the entire object

### Key Differences:

|Feature|**PUT**|**PATCH**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Replaces the entire resource|Partially updates the resource|
|**Request Body**|Requires the entire resource (or full state)|Only requires the fields to be updated|
|**Operation**|Full replacement (even if only one field is changed)|Partial modification (only sends changed fields)|
|**Idempotent**|Yes|Typically yes, but depends on the implementation|
|**Use Case**|When updating or replacing the full resource|When updating a subset of fields in the resource|
