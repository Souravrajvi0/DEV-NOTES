1. Database Design
2. API Design
Always remember that if done good planning then writing code is pretty easy!

The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design in software engineering. It states that **a class should have only one reason to change**, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. In simpler terms, a class should focus on a single part of the functionality provided by the software.

-> BEFORE WRITING A SINGLE LINE OF CODE WE HAVE TO JUST DEFINE THE WHOLE SYSTEM NOT JUST 
-> THE Better Planning you do it's easier to code afterwards!

-> When We work in MNC we're expected to change the databases very less

### What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
1. **Interface**: An API defines how different software components should interact. It specifies the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
    
2. **Documentation**: APIs come with documentation that describes the available endpoints, request methods, parameters, and response formats.
    
3. **Implementation**: The actual code that implements the API (the backend logic) is separate and resides on the server. The API acts as a bridge between the client (user or application) and the server

Now Inke sabke khudke maps toh hai nahi bhai! Toh ye log fir kaise kar rahe hain track ??? aur inke pass maps kahan se aarahe hain!
Toh Zomato map kahan se laata hai??
ab Zomato directly toh google maps ka data access kar nahi skta

APIs function like messengers, requesting and delivering data between applications and systems without revealing internal processes or recipes. They only provide final products to users

Agar zomato ko data chahiye toh wo google maps ki api ko bolega and wahan se request jayegi google maps k system k pass and agar request approve hogayi toh in that case api data return kar dega zomato ko ya fir error aa jayega

api system ka how nahi what batata hai!
aise mtlb api burger ki recipe nahi pura burger hi de dega 
API EK BLACK BOX KI TRAH HAI
API key is given to developers who wants to access the apis of a service

**REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces)** are a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. They allow different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet in a stateless, client-server architecture. REST APIs are widely used for creating web services and are based on standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
### **Stateless**:

- **Stateless** means that each request from the client to the server is independent. The server **does not remember any previous requests** from the client. Every request contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and respond to it.
### **Client-Server Architecture**:

- **Client-Server** means that the application is divided into two parts: the **client** and the **server**. The client is responsible for interacting with the user (e.g., a web app or mobile app), and the server is responsible for processing requests and managing data.
-
### Key Concepts of REST APIs:

1. **Resources**: In REST, everything is considered a resource, which is typically represented by a URL. For example, in a REST API for a bookstore, `/books` could represent the collection of books, and `/books/123` could represent a specific book.
    
2. **HTTP Methods**:
    - **GET**: Retrieve data from a server (e.g., fetch a list of books).
    - **POST**: Send data to the server to create a new resource (e.g., add a new book).
    - **PUT**: Update an existing resource on the server (e.g., edit a book's details).
    - **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server (e.g., delete a book).
3. **Stateless**: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to process it. The server does not store any information about the client state between requests.
    
4. **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: Each resource is identified by a URI. For example, `/users/1` might be the URI for a user with ID 1.
    
5. **Representation**: Resources can be represented in different formats like JSON, XML, HTML, etc., but JSON is the most commonly used format in REST APIs.
    
6. **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server are separated, meaning they can evolve independently. The client handles the user interface and sends requests, while the server processes these requests and sends back the responses.

-> HTTPS protocol has many methods GET, PUT, PATCH,  DELETE etc so these api's can differentiated can be under these methods!
