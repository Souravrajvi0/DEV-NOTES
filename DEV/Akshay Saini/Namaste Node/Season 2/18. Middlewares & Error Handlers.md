In Express.js (and similar frameworks), `.use()` is a method used to **register middleware**. Middleware are functions that intercept HTTP requests coming into the server, process them, and decide whether to pass control to the next middleware function or to send a response directly.

### **What Exactly Is `.use()`?**

`.use()` is a method provided by the `express` object that allows you to define middleware that will be applied to all routes or specific routes, depending on how itâ€™s used. It essentially "hooks" the middleware function into the request-response cycle of the server.

### **How Does `.use()` Work?**

- **Global Middleware**: When you use `.use()` without specifying a route, it applies the middleware function to **every incoming request**, regardless of the request's HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) or the request URL.
### **Key Points About `.use()`**:

1. **Order Matters**: Middleware functions are executed in the order they are registered using `.use()`. If you register multiple middleware's, they will be executed in sequence, and control is passed to the next middleware using the `next()` function.
    `app.use(middleware1); app.use(middleware2);` 

**General-purpose Middleware**: `.use()` is versatile because it can handle requests regardless of the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), making it suitable for tasks like logging, authentication, error handling, etc. 

**Path Matching**: When you specify a path, `.use()` matches that path and any sub paths. For example, `app.use('/users')` will match both `/users` and `/users/123`.

**Error Handling Middleware**: You can also use `.use()` to register error-handling middleware, which requires an additional argument (the error object):

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {     
console.error(err.stack);     
res.status(500).send('Something broke!'); 
});
```

->Now What if we don't send any response from the route handler function -> KUCH DERR TAK CHLTA RAHEGA WITH NO RESPONSE AND TIMEOUT AAJAYEGA 

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next)=>{     
console.log("ENTRY HUI HAI ROUTE HANDLER FUNCTION MEIN AND USKE BAD CONSTROL BAS GHUMTA HI RAHEGA ANDAR");
});     
```

The same will happen again loop mein chlta rahega and kuch nahi hoga!

**ONE ROUTE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE ROUTE HANDLERS**

-> Yahan 2nd Response send hoga!
-> When We call the next function The control goes to the next route handler

IN This case Kya hoga??? Well Next se control dusre route handler mein gaya and then vahan se repsonse se send hua but control vapis first route handler mein toh ayega hi nahi since basic JS kasie execute hota hai!!!! Now Response send krne ki koshish hogi from the route handler 1.TOH ERROR AA JAYEGA
-> WE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE Route Handlers!

Can also be done like this!
`next()` in the first handler, the control will go to the next matching middleware or route handler that shares the same path and method
![18. Middlewares & Error Handlers-20241017224517903.webp](../../../Images/18.%20Middlewares%20&%20Error%20Handlers-20241017224517903.webp)
-> Ismein bhi 2nd response aayega!! Even in case of multiple routehandlers made using get method 
`next()` in the first handler, the control will go to the next matching middleware or route handler that shares the same path and method


```javascript
app.use('/user', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Handling the route user in middleware!!");
  next();
});

app.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  console.log("Handling the route user in GET handler!!");
  res.send("GET Route Handler");
});
```

### What Happens in This Scenario:

1. The `app.use('/user')` middleware will run on any request to `/user`, regardless of the HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.).
2. When you call `next()` in this middleware, control passes to the next matching route or middleware. In this example, if the request is a `GET` request, it will pass control to the next `app.get('/user')` handler.
3. The `app.get('/user')` handler then logs `"Handling the route user in GET handler!!"` and sends the response.
EXAMPLE:
->If you call `next()` within a `GET` handler, control will go to the next handler with the same method and route (another `app.get('/user')` if it exists).
->`app.use('/user')` can pass control to either another `app.use('/user')` middleware or to a specific method-based handler like `app.get('/user')`, depending on the route and request method

-> 2nd route handler toh kabhi call bhi nahi hua!

![Pasted image 20250523104748.png](../../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250523104748.png)
Multiple route handlers in `app.use()` are needed in Express.js (or other web frameworks) to allow for modular and flexible handling of different types of requests. Here's why they are important:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By using multiple handlers, you can break down your code into smaller, focused units. Each handler can perform a specific task, like authentication, logging, data validation, or processing a particular type of request. This makes the code easier to manage and debug.
    
2. **Middleware Chain**: Express allows you to define a chain of middleware functions that are executed in sequence. Multiple handlers in `app.use()` help in setting up this middleware chain. For example:
    
    - First middleware checks authentication.
    - Second middleware checks permissions.
    - Third middleware processes the actual request.
    
    Each middleware can either pass control to the next handler or send a response back to the client.
    
3. **Reusability**: Different parts of the application might need similar pre-processing (like parsing JSON, handling cookies, or dealing with CORS). Using multiple route handlers allows you to write these processes once and apply them to different routes.
    
4. **Modular Design**: You can organize your app into separate modules, each responsible for specific tasks (like user management, orders, payments, etc.). With multiple `app.use()` handlers, you can mount these modules under different routes, making the app scalable and easier to extend.
    
5. **Error Handling**: You can have specific middleware to handle errors, ensuring that errors caught at any stage are handled properly. Multiple route handlers allow you to customize error responses for different types of routes or errors.

If you define a route using methods like `get`, `patch`, or `put` for `/work`, they **won't automatically match** a route like `/work/user`. Each route definition is specific to the path you provide.
The route `/work/user` is distinct from `/work`. A request to `/work/user` will not match `/work` unless you use a more flexible path pattern like `/work/*` or middleware for the `/work` base route.
When using `app.use()`, it works a bit differently compared to methods like `get`, `post`, `patch`, or `put`. `app.use()` matches all requests that start with the specified path, regardless of the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and whether the path has additional subpaths.

-> In Express, while you can have multiple middleware functions, only **one of them should ultimately send a response** for a given request.
-> When you register multiple middleware or route handlers using `app.use()` in Express, each `app.use()` can contain its own set of middleware functions or routes. Each of these can independently send a response as long as they handle different paths or are part of different middleware stacks.

![18. Middlewares & Error Handlers-20241017232104335.webp](../../../Images/18.%20Middlewares%20&%20Error%20Handlers-20241017232104335.webp)
-> In This case .get() mein control jaega hi nahi!
-> When you have both `app.use()` and `app.get()` (or any other route method) with the same route in an Express application, the behavior will depend on the order in which you define them and whether they call `next()` or send a response.

### Key Points:

1. **Order Matters**: Express processes middleware and routes in the order they are defined. If you have `app.use()` before `app.get()`, the middleware will execute first.
2. **Response Handling**: If either the `app.use()` middleware or the `app.get()` route handler sends a response, the response cycle is considered complete, and no further middleware or route handlers will be executed for that request.
3. **Middleware vs. Route Handler**: Middleware can be used for common tasks (like logging, authentication, etc.) and usually calls `next()` to pass control. Route handlers are typically designed to send a response.

```javascript

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware for /test
app.use('/test', (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Middleware for /test');
    // Sending a response here
    res.send('Response from middleware for /test');
    // If we call next() here, the next route will also execute
});

// Route handler for /test
app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
    console.log('This will not run if the middleware sends a response.');
    res.send('Response from /test route handler');  // This won't execute
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Behavior:

1. When a request is made to `/test`, the middleware is executed first.
2. The middleware sends a response with `res.send()`. At this point, the request cycle is complete.
3. The route handler for `/test` is **never executed** because the response has already been sent by the middleware.

### If Middleware Does Not Send a Response:

-> If the middleware does not send a response and instead calls `next()`, then the request will continue to the route handler.
-> If a middleware function in Express neither sends a response nor calls `next()`, it will result in the request being left hanging, and the server will not know how to respond.

If you define an `app.get()` route handler first and it contains a call to `next()`, the request will continue to the next middleware or route handler defined after it. This can work effectively, but you need to be careful about the flow of responses. Hereâ€™s how it works in detail:

### Scenario:

1. **Route Handler Calls `next()`**: If the `app.get()` route handler calls `next()`, it effectively passes control to the next middleware or route handler in line.
2. **Subsequent Middleware or Route Handlers**: Any middleware or route handlers defined after the `app.get()` will then have a chance to process the request

-> It is often a good practice to define your middleware first and then your route handlers in an Express application. This approach offers several advantages:

### Advantages of Middleware First:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By placing middleware before your route handlers, you can separate common functionality (like logging, authentication, or data parsing) from the route logic. This makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
    
2. **Control Over Flow**: Middleware functions can control the flow of request processing. They can perform tasks like validating user input or checking authentication before allowing the request to reach the actual route handler.
    
3. **Easier Error Handling**: If you define middleware that handles errors (e.g., for catching exceptions), placing it before route handlers ensures that errors can be caught and handled appropriately without cluttering the route handler logic.
    
4. **Reusability**: Middleware can be reused across multiple routes. By defining them first, you can apply them to any route as needed without duplicating code.
    
5. **Cleaner Response Management**: By handling common tasks in middleware, your route handlers can focus solely on sending the appropriate responses for each route, reducing complexity.


**Express (Node.js)**: If you define multiple routes with the same method (`GET`) and the same path, only the last one defined will be executed. The reason is that each route overwrites the previous one.


```javascript
app.get('/example', (req, res) => {   
res.send('First handler'); });  

app.get('/example', (req, res) => {   
res.send('Second handler'); });`

In this case, if a user visits `/example`, the browser will get "Second handler" as the response because the second route overwrites the first.

```

### STATUS CODE 

In Express (and HTTP in general), status codes are three-digit numbers returned by the server to indicate the outcome of a client's request. They help the client understand whether the request was successful, encountered an error, or needs further action. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of common HTTP status codes used in Express/Node.js:
### 1xx: Informational

- **100 Continue**: The initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server is switching protocols as requested by the client.

### 2xx: Success

- **200 OK**: The request has succeeded. This is the most common response for successful GET requests.
- **201 Created**: The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result (commonly used in POST requests).
- **204 No Content**: The server has successfully processed the request, but there is no content to return.

### 3xx: Redirection

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been moved to a new URL, and the client should use that URL in the future.
- **302 Found**: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL. The client should continue to use the original URL for future requests.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request, so the client can use its cached version.

### 4xx: Client Errors

- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires user authentication, and the client has not provided valid credentials.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The server could not find the requested resource.
- **409 Conflict**: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.

### 5xx: Server Errors

- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.

### How to Use Status Codes in Express

In an Express application, you can send status codes in your responses using the `res.status()` method or by chaining the `status` method with `send` or `json`. Here are some examples:
BY DEAFULT WHEN WE DO res.send() -> HERE WE'RE SENDING CODE 200

`res.status(201).json({ message: 'Resource created successfully!' });`
- The `{ message: 'Resource created successfully!' }` is a **JavaScript object**, not JSON.
- When we pass this JavaScript object to `.json()`, Express automatically converts it to a JSON string before sending it in the response.
- During this conversion, Express turns the key into a JSON-compliant string: `{"message": "Resource created successfully!"}`.

```javascript
const express = require('express'); 
const app = express(); 
app.get('/success', (req, res) => { 
res.status(200).send('Request was successful!'); 
}); 
app.post('/create', (req, res) => {
// Assuming resource creation logic here 
res.status(201).json({ message: 'Resource created successfully!' }); 
});
```

-> LOOK AT THIS CODE DON'T YOU SEE LOGIC BARI BARI LIKHA JA RAHA HAI
-> Doesn't it make sense to use a middleware jo pehle check karle ki ye admin ye authorised ha ya nahi and then we can move onto further Tasks to do whatever I want to do!

In Express, both `app.all()` and `app.use()` are middleware functions, but they serve different purposes and have distinct use cases.
### 1. `app.all()`

- **Purpose**: This method is used to define middleware that handles **all HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for a specific route.
    
- **Usage**: It matches the specified route for **every HTTP method** and can be used to apply logic like logging, authentication, or validation for any method hitting that route.
-

```javascript
app.all('/example', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('This runs for all HTTP methods on /example');
  next(); // Passes control to the next handler
});

app.get('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to /example');
});

app.post('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to /example');
});
```

### 2. `app.use()`

- **Purpose**: This method is used to mount middleware functions that execute **regardless of the HTTP method** and are not tied to specific HTTP verbs. The primary purpose of `app.use()` is to define middleware for processing all incoming requests or for specific paths (it works more like global middleware).
    
- **Usage**: It is typically used for tasks such as logging, parsing request bodies, error handling, or applying middleware to a set of routes.
    
- **Path Matching**: `app.use()` applies to any route that **starts** with the specified path, not just exact matches.


```javascript
// Global middleware applied to all routes
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Global middleware for every request');
  next(); // Passes control to the next middleware or route handler
});

// Middleware applied only to routes starting with '/example'
app.use('/example', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware for all routes starting with /example');
  next(); // Passes control to the next middleware or route handler
});

app.get('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to /example');
});

app.post('/example/data', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to /example/data');
});

```

### Key Differences Between `app.all()` and `app.use()`

|**Aspect**|**`app.all()`**|**`app.use()`**|
|---|---|---|
|**HTTP Methods**|Matches **all HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)|Matches **any HTTP method** but not tied to a specific one|
|**Path Matching**|Matches the **exact path**|Matches paths that **start with the specified path**|
|**Typical Usage**|Used to handle logic for **all methods** on a specific route|Used for **middleware** logic applied globally or to specific paths|
|**Common Use Cases**|Authentication, validation, logic for all methods on a route|Logging, parsing, global middleware, error handling|

## ERROR HANDLING 
We can even stimulate the error! By doing -> throw new Error("HELLOW NEW ERROR IS THIS");
![18. Middlewares & Error Handlers-20241018094233013.webp](../../../Images/18.%20Middlewares%20&%20Error%20Handlers-20241018094233013.webp)

In Express.js, a `try` and `catch` block is used inside a route handler to handle errors that might occur during the execution of code, especially for asynchronous operations or any code that might throw an error. The `try` block contains code that could potentially throw an error, and the `catch` block is used to handle that error gracefully without crashing the server.

### Why Use `try-catch` in Route Handlers?

1. **Error Handling**: If something goes wrong, such as a database query failing or some other unexpected issue, the `catch` block ensures that the error is caught and dealt with (for example, by sending an appropriate error response to the client).
2. **Prevent Crashes**: Without error handling, an unhandled error in a route could crash the entire server. The `try-catch` block prevents this by managing exceptions locally.
3. **Asynchronous Operations**: In modern Express apps, route handlers often involve asynchronous code (e.g., database queries, API calls), which can throw errors. A `try-catch` block allows you to handle these errors in a clean way.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Example route with try-catch

```javascript
app.get('/example', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Simulating a possible error (e.g., database call, external API call)
    let result = await someAsyncOperation();
    
    // If the operation is successful, send a success response
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Operation successful', data: result });
  } catch (error) {
    // If an error occurs, handle it in the catch block
    console.error('Error occurred:', error.message);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Something went wrong', error: error.message });
  }
});

async function someAsyncOperation() {
  // Simulating an error in an async operation
  throw new Error('Simulated failure');
}

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

### How It Works:

1. **`try` Block**:
    - The route handler wraps the potentially error-prone code (e.g., `someAsyncOperation()`) in a `try` block.
    - If the code in the `try` block executes successfully, the route sends a success response (with status code `200`).
2. **`catch` Block**:
    - If an error occurs inside the `try` block (for example, the `someAsyncOperation()` throws an error), the flow jumps to the `catch` block.
    - The error is logged, and a response is sent back with an appropriate error message and a `500` status code (indicating an internal server error).

### Handling Asynchronous Errors

In modern Express applications, many operations are asynchronous (like database queries or file system operations). Using `try-catch` blocks with `async`/`await` ensures that errors in asynchronous code are caught correctly.


```javascript
app.get('/user/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Fetching user from a database (simulating async operation)
    const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);
    
    // If user not found, throw an error
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error('User not found');
    }

    // Send the user data back to the client
    res.status(200).json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors (including user not found or database failures)
    res.status(404).json({ message: error.message });
  }
});

```
### Error Handling in Express

In Express, when an error occurs in a route handler or middleware, the normal flow of `next()` (which moves the request to the next middleware or route handler) changes. If `next()` is called with an error (i.e., `next(err)`), Express **skips all the remaining regular middleware and route handlers** and jumps directly to **error-handling middleware**. This is how the flow ends up in the centralized error-handling middleware.// YE HUMNE END MEIN DALA THA 
### Centralized Error Handling with Middleware
Centralized error handling with middleware in Express allows you to manage all errors in one place, making your code cleaner, more maintainable, and ensuring consistent error responses. Instead of handling errors in every route individually (e.g., using `try-catch` in each route handler), you define a single, global error-handling middleware that catches any errors thrown by your application and sends an appropriate response.


### Why Use Centralized Error Handling?

1. **Cleaner Code**: You avoid having repetitive `try-catch` blocks in every route handler.
2. **Consistency**: All errors are handled uniformly, ensuring that the client always gets a consistent error response.
3. **Maintainability**: If you need to change how errors are handled, you only need to update the centralized error handler.
4. **Better Debugging**: You can log errors centrally and keep track of all exceptions that occur across your application.

In Express, any errors that occur during request handling can be passed to a centralized error handler using `next(error)`. Express automatically recognizes middleware with **four parameters** (`err, req, res, next`) as an error-handling middleware.

### Setting Up Centralized Error Handling

#### 1. Basic Error Handling Middleware

Hereâ€™s how to set up a simple error-handling middleware:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();


```javascript
// Example route
app.get('/example', (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Simulating an error
    throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
  } catch (error) {
    next(error); // Passing the error to the centralized error handler
  }
});

// Centralized error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack); // Log the error for debugging
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### How It Works:

1. **Error Propagation**: If an error occurs in a route handler (e.g., `/example`), itâ€™s passed to the `next()` function with the error object, like `next(error)`.
2. **Error-Handling Middleware**: The error-handling middleware, defined with four parameters (`err, req, res, next`), catches any errors passed to `next(error)`.
3. **Error Response**: The middleware logs the error (or performs other actions, like sending logs to a logging service) and then sends a response with an appropriate status code and error message

### 2. Handling Asynchronous Errors with Centralized Error Handling

For asynchronous code (e.g., `async`/`await` operations or promises), errors are not automatically caught, so you still need to catch them and pass them to `next(error)`.


```javascript
app.get('/async-route', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation (e.g., database query)
    let result = await someAsyncOperation();
    res.status(200).json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error); // Passes the error to the centralized error handler
  }
});
```

### 3. Customizing the Error Response

You can customize the response based on the error type or status:


```javascript
// Custom error class
class NotFoundError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.status = 404;
  }
}

app.get('/resource/:id', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const resource = await findResourceById(req.params.id); // Simulated async operation
    if (!resource) {
      throw new NotFoundError('Resource not found');
    }
    res.status(200).json(resource);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error); // Pass the error to the centralized error handler
  }
});
```



### 4. Throwing Custom Errors

You can create custom errors and throw them in your route handlers to trigger specific error responses:


-> Error-handling middleware in Express is also defined using `app.use()`, but with one key difference: it has **four parameters** (`err, req, res, next`) instead of the usual three (`req, res, next`).
#### Why Use `app.use()` for Error Handling?

1. **Middleware Pattern**: Express operates using a middleware pattern. When you define error-handling middleware with `app.use()`, itâ€™s part of this middleware stack. Express automatically forwards errors that occur in route handlers or other middleware to the error-handling middleware.
    
2. **Catching All Errors**: When you use `app.use()` for error handling, it can catch any unhandled errors from routes or other middleware. Without it, you would have to handle errors manually inside each route handler or middleware.


```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // Handle the error and send a response
  res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
});

```

### Why Place `app.use()` for Error Handling at the End of the Code?

In Express, middleware and route handlers are executed in the order they are defined. This means the order in which you define your `app.use()` middleware matters.
- **Middleware Flow**: When a request comes in, it passes through middleware functions and route handlers in the order they are defined. If no error occurs, the request is processed normally, and an appropriate response is sent. However, if an error occurs during this process, Express skips the remaining non-error middleware and looks for the error-handling middleware.
- **Catch All Errors**: By placing the error-handling middleware at the **end**, you ensure that it catches any error that might have been thrown earlier in the route handling or other middleware. If the error-handling middleware is placed too early, errors occurring in later route handlers or middleware might not be caught, and they could go unhandled.
- **Graceful Fallback**: The last middleware in your app should either be a 404 handler or an error handler. This is because if none of the earlier route handlers match the request or if an error occurs, you want the application to gracefully handle the situation by sending an appropriate error message instead of leaving the request hanging.


```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Non-error middleware (general middleware)
app.use(express.json()); // Parses incoming JSON requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`); // Logs every request
  next(); // Proceed to the next middleware/route handler
});

// Some route handlers
app.get('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is an example route');
});

// Error-handling middleware (placed at the end)
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Error:', err.message);
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
});

// 404 handler (for requests that donâ€™t match any routes)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.status(404).json({ message: 'Route not found' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Breakdown:

1. **General Middleware (`app.use(express.json())`)**: This middleware runs for every request to parse incoming JSON data.
    
2. **Request Logger Middleware**: Logs every request method and URL. Placed near the beginning so that it can log all incoming requests.
    
3. **Route Handler**: Defines a simple route (`/example`) to handle GET requests. If this route throws an error or an error occurs during processing, Express will pass that error to the error-handling middleware.
    
4. **Error-Handling Middleware**: Defined using `app.use((err, req, res, next))`. This middleware is at the end of the stack to ensure it catches any errors that occur in the previous routes or middleware.
    
5. **404 Handler**: Also defined at the end, this middleware catches requests that donâ€™t match any route and returns a "Not Found" message. It ensures that any unmatched routes result in a graceful 404 response.

### Visualizing the Flow:

Hereâ€™s a simplified view of how a request flows through middleware and error handling:

1. **Incoming request** â†’ **Middleware 1** â†’ **Middleware 2** â†’ **Route Handler** â†’ **Error Occurs** â†’ **Error-Handling Middleware**.

If no error occurs:

- Request flows from one middleware to the next via `next()`.

If an error occurs:

- The request skips to the error-handling middleware if `next(error)` is called.

#### 2. Flow with Errors (`next(error)`)

When you call `next(error)`, Express skips the regular middleware and route handlers, looking specifically for **error-handling middleware** (with four parameters: `err, req, res, next`).


```javascript
app.get('/example', (req, res, next) => {
  const error = new Error('Something went wrong');
  next(error); // Passes the error to the centralized error-handling middleware
});

// Error-handling middleware (must be defined at the end)
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Error:', err.message);
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
});

```

Hereâ€™s what happens:

1. An error occurs in the `/example` route.
2. `next(error)` is called, signaling to Express that something went wrong.
3. Express **skips all remaining middleware and routes** and directly moves to the error-handling middleware at the end (`app.use((err, req, res, next) => { ... })`).
4. The error is logged and a `500 Internal Server Error` response is sent to the client
