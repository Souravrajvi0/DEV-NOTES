-> In a typical token-based authentication flow, a token (like a JWT) is sent with each request after the user logs in
1. **Login**: The user sends their credentials (e.g., username and password) to the server.
2. **Token Issuance**: Upon successful authentication, the server generates a token and sends it back to the user.
3. **Subsequent Requests**: For each subsequent API call (like accessing the `/profile`, sending requests, or updating data), the user includes the token in the request headers (commonly in the `Authorization` header).
4.  Validation: The server validates the token with each request to ensure it's still valid and has not expired.

This process helps maintain secure sessions without needing to send sensitive credentials repeatedly

### JWT and Cookies Workflow

1. **Login Process**:
    
    - The user logs in by sending their credentials (e.g., email and password) to the server.
    - The server validates the credentials and generates a JWT token.
2. **Token in Cookie**:
    
    - Instead of sending the JWT token directly in the response body, the server wraps the token in a cookie.
    - This cookie can have attributes like `HttpOnly` and `Secure` for added security:
        - **HttpOnly**: Prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS attacks.
        - **Secure**: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.
3. **Browser Storage**:
    
    - The browser automatically saves this cookie. The cookie is unique to the user and the session.
4. **Subsequent API Requests**:
    
    - For each subsequent API call, the browser includes the cookie in the request headers.
    - The server extracts the JWT from the cookie and validates it.
5. **Validation**:
    
    - The server checks:
        - If the token is valid (not expired, correctly signed, etc.).
        - If the token has the necessary permissions for the requested resource.
6. **Cookie Expiry**:
    
    - You can set an expiration date for the cookie. If the cookie is old or expired, the server will reject the request.

### Benefits of Using Cookies with JWT:

- **Security**: Cookies can be more secure against certain types of attacks compared to sending tokens in headers.
- **Automatic Handling**: Browsers automatically send cookies with requests to the same domain, simplifying the client-side code.

-> Where should we write the code ??? 
The block in which where we've verified the user after the first login!

A **cookie** is a small piece of data that a web server sends to a user's web browser, which is then stored on the user's device. Cookies are used for various purposes, including:
1. **Session Management**: Cookies can store session identifiers, allowing users to stay logged in as they navigate through different pages of a website.
    
2. **Personalization**: Cookies can remember user preferences, such as language settings or theme choices, to provide a more personalized experience.
    
3. **Tracking and Analytics**: Cookies help track user behavior on a website, enabling website owners to analyze traffic, user interactions, and improve their services.

### Types of Cookies:

- **Session Cookies**: Temporary cookies that are deleted once the browser is closed. They are used to maintain state during a user's session.
    
- **Persistent Cookies**: Remain on the user's device for a specified period or until deleted. They are used for remembering login details or user preferences.
    
- **First-Party Cookies**: Set by the website the user is currently visiting. They are commonly used for session management and personalization.
    
- **Third-Party Cookies**: Set by domains other than the one the user is visiting, often used for advertising and tracking across different website

### Security Considerations:

Cookies can pose security risks, such as being vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. To mitigate these risks, developers can use attributes like `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite`:

- **HttpOnly**: Prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.
- **Secure**: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections.
- **SameSite**: Restricts how cookies are sent with cross-site requests, helping to prevent CSRF attacks.

![23. Authentication, JWT & Cookies-20241019172626202.webp](../../../Images/23.%20Authentication,%20JWT%20&%20Cookies-20241019172626202.webp)
We  use `res.cookie()` to store a JWT (JSON Web Token) in cookies. This is a common way to handle user authentication by storing the JWT in the user's browser so it can be sent with subsequent requests.

Here's how it works:

1. **JWT Generation**: After the user logs in or registers, you generate a JWT on the server, which contains encoded data (like the user's ID) and is signed with a secret.
    
2. **Send JWT as Cookie**: You store the JWT in a cookie using `res.cookie()`, and the browser will automatically send this cookie back to the server with every request to the same domain, allowing the server to verify the user's identity.
    
3. **Server Verifies JWT**: On subsequent requests, the server retrieves the JWT from the cookie, verifies its authenticity, and uses the contained data (e.g., user information) to proceed with the request.


```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  // User authentication logic here (e.g., check username and password)
  
  // If authenticated, generate a JWT token
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, 'secretKey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
  
  // Set the JWT as a cookie in the response
  res.cookie('token', token, { httpOnly: true, secure: true, maxAge: 3600000 }); // secure: true for HTTPS
  res.send('Logged in');
});

```
The first argument in `res.cookie()` (in your example, `"token"`) is simply the **name of the cookie**. It doesn’t have to be `"token"` specifically—you can name the cookie anything you want. The name you choose depends on what the cookie is being used for.

### Example:

- If you're storing a **JWT token** for authentication, you might call it `"token"` or `"authToken"`.
- If you're storing **session data**, you might call it `"sessionId"`.
- If you're storing **user preferences**, you could name it `"theme"` or `"language"`.




-> When working with cookies in a Node.js application, especially using Express, you typically need to parse the cookies before you can read them. This is where the `cookie-parser` library comes in handy
When working with cookies in a Node.js application, using a library like `cookie-parser` is essential for a few reasons:
### Why Parse Cookies?

1. **Format Handling**: Cookies are sent as a single string in the HTTP headers. For example, a cookie might look like this:
    `jwt=your_jwt_token; sessionId=abc123; userId=xyz789`
Parsing converts this string into a more manageable JavaScript object, allowing you to easily access individual cookie values without manually splitting and processing the string.

1. **Convenience**: The `cookie-parser` middleware automatically parses the cookies for you and attaches them to the `req.cookies` object. This simplifies your code, as you can access cookies directly by their names
   `const jwtToken = req.cookies.jwt;`
1. **Error Handling**: Parsing libraries often handle potential errors or malformed cookies more gracefully than manual parsing would. This helps ensure that your application remains robust even if unexpected cookie formats are encountered.
    
2. **Middleware Integration**: By using `cookie-parser` as middleware in your Express app, you ensure that cookies are parsed for every incoming request. This means you don’t have to repeat parsing logic in every route handler.


```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

const app = express();
app.use(cookieParser()); // Middleware to parse cookies

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    // Access a specific cookie
    const jwtToken = req.cookies.jwt; // Access the 'jwt' cookie
    if (jwtToken) {
        res.send(`JWT Token: ${jwtToken}`);
    } else {
        res.send('No JWT Token found');
    }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

# JWT TOKEN

A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

### Structure of a JWT

A JWT typically consists of three parts, separated by dots (`.`):
1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, including the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm used (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA).
    `{   "alg": "HS256",   "typ": "JWT" }`

**2.Payload**: Contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims
**3.Signature**: To create the signature part, you take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret (or a private key), and the algorithm specified in the header. This ensures that the token hasn’t been altered.

### Use Cases

- **Authentication**: After a user logs in, a JWT can be generated and sent back to the client. The client can then send this token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests, allowing the server to verify the user's identity.
    
- **Information Exchange**: JWTs can securely transmit information between parties because they can be signed (ensuring the integrity of the claims) and optionally encrypted (ensuring confidentiality)

### Advantages

- **Compact**: Can be sent via URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header.
- **Self-contained**: Contains all the information needed about the user, reducing the need to query the database multiple times.
- **Cross-domain**: Can be used across different domains, making it suitable for microservices architectures.

### Explanation of JWT Creation

1. **JWT Creation**:
    
    `let token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, "DEV@Tinder$799", { algorithm: 'RS256' });`
    
    - **`jwt.sign`**: This function creates the JWT.
    - **Payload**: `{ _id: user._id }` is the payload, which contains the user ID. This is the information that is encoded in the token.
    - **Secret Key**: `"DEV@Tinder$799"` is a secret key used to sign the token. In a production environment, this should be kept secret and secure.
    - **Algorithm**: `RS256` is an asymmetric signing algorithm. It uses a public/private key pair for signing and verification.
2. **Storing the JWT**:
    
    - When the user logs in, this token is created and can be stored in a cookie. This allows the server to identify the user in subsequent requests.
    - HOW TO STORE `res.cookie("token",token)`

### Understanding Cookie Hijacking

**Cookie Hijacking**:

- **Definition**: Cookie hijacking (or session hijacking) occurs when an attacker steals a user's session cookie, allowing them to impersonate the user without needing their credentials.
- **How it Works**:
    - If an attacker gains access to the user's cookie (through methods like XSS attacks, network sniffing, or physical access), they can send requests to the server as if they were the legitimate user.
    - Since the JWT is stored in the cookie, the server will accept the requests because the token is valid and signed.


```javascript
const decodedMessage = jwt.verify(token, "DEV@Tinder$799", function(err, decoded) {
    // ...
});

```
1. **`jwt.verify`**: This function is used to verify the authenticity of a JWT. It checks if the token is valid and not expired, and it uses the secret key to perform this verification.
    
2. **Parameters**:
    
    - **`token`**: This is the JWT that you want to verify.
    - **`"DEV@Tinder$799"`**: This is the secret key used to sign the JWT. It must match the key used when the token was created.
    - **Callback Function**: The callback function takes two parameters: `err` (for any errors during verification) and `decoded` (the decoded payload of the token if verification is successful).

### What Will `decodedMessage` Contain?

When the JWT is successfully verified, the `decoded` object will typically contain: THE PAYLOAD VALUE WHICH WE'VE ADDED TO IT!

![23. Authentication, JWT & Cookies-20241019184910693.webp](../../../Images/23.%20Authentication,%20JWT%20&%20Cookies-20241019184910693.webp)


```javascript
app.post("/login",async(req,res)=>{
  try{
   const {emailId,password}=req.body;
   const user=await User.findOne({emailId:emailId});
   if(!user){
    res.send("Invalid credentials");
   }
   const isPasswordValid=await bcrypt.compare(password,user.password);
   if(!isPasswordValid){
     throw new Error("Wrong Password")
   }else{
   // IN THIS BLOCK WE WILL ENTER WHEN WE WILL BE SUCCESFULLY LOGGED IN
   // CREATE A JWT TOKEN 
   let token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, "DEV@Tinder$799");
// ADD THE TOKEN TO THE COOKIE AND SEND THE RESPONSE BACK TO THE USER
    res.cookie("token",token);
    res.send("Login Sucessfully");
   }
   }catch(err){
   res.status(400).send("ERROR IS COMING"+ err.message);
  }
})
```


```javascript
app.get("/profile",async(req,res)=>{
// HERE I WANT TO VALIDATE MY COOKIE JO KI PICHLE LOGIN K BAD HMARE PASS AI THI
try{
 const cookie=req.cookies;
 const{token}=cookie;
 if(!token){
  throw new Error("Invalid token");
 }
 const decodedMessage= await jwt.verify(token, "DEV@Tinder$799")
const {_id}=decodedMessage;
// Now we know who the logged in used is
const user=await User.findOne({_id});
if(!user){
  throw new Error("User not found");
}
 res.send(user);
}catch(error){
  res.status(400).send("Something went wrong"+ error.message);
}
});
```

->So out of all the api's I will create only two won't work without any authentication other than that all will work with authentication.
SO JABH HAR BAR AUTHENTICATION HOTA HAI TOH FIR EK KAM KARO NA EK MIDDLEWARE HI BANA LO userAuth k name se!
-> This way it will help me authenticate every request that I receive and So make a new middleware in the middleware folder and use it 

ADMIN AUTH CODE 


```javascript
const jwt=require("jsonwebtoken");
const User=require("../models/user.js");
const userAuth= async(req,res,next) =>{
// READ THE TOKEN FROM THE REQUEST
try{
// get the token
const{token}=req.cookies;
if(!token){
    throw new Error("token is not valid");
}
// verify the token
const decodedobj= await jwt.verify(token,"DEV@Tinder$799");
const {_id}=decodedobj;
// find the user
const user=await User.findById(_id);
if(!user){
    throw new Error("User not found");
}
req.user=user;
next();
}catch(error){
    res.status(400).send("Something went wrong"+ error.message);
}

}
module.exports={
    userAuth
}

```

Now In app.js file we can just import it!
`const{userAuth}=require("./middleware/adminauth.js");`



```javascript
app.get("/profile",userAuth,async(req,res)=>{
try{
if (!req.user) {
    throw new Error("User information is missing");
   }
  
  res.send(req.user); // Send the authenticated user's details
}catch(error){
  res.status(400).send("Something went wrong"+ error.message);
}
});
```

### The Theme Park Story: The Golden Ticket

Imagine you're going to a famous theme park, called "Token Park," which has several different rides and attractions. Here's how the process works:

---

#### **Step 1: Getting the Ticket (Logging In)**

When you first arrive at the theme park's entrance, you go to the ticket counter (this is like the **login page**). You show them your ID and pay for your ticket (this is like **entering your username and password**). After verifying that you’re who you say you are, the park staff gives you a **Golden Ticket** (this is your **JWT token**).

The Golden Ticket has your name and a special code on it, showing that you've paid and you're allowed to enjoy the park.

---

#### **Step 2: Using the Ticket (Making Authenticated Requests)**

Now that you have your Golden Ticket, you don't need to show your ID or pay again every time you want to go on a ride. Instead, you just show the Golden Ticket to the ride attendants at each attraction. They take a quick look, see that it’s valid, and let you on the ride.

This is like the **server** checking the token every time you send a request. Instead of asking for your login details each time, the server just checks the token (Golden Ticket) to see if you’re allowed to access that specific resource (ride).

---

#### **Step 3: Expiry of the Ticket (Token Expiration)**

Your Golden Ticket isn’t valid forever. Let’s say it’s only good for **one day**. At the end of the day, your ticket expires, and the staff won’t let you on any rides anymore.

In the same way, JWT tokens have an expiration time. Once they expire, you can no longer use them to access resources (like the rides in the park) unless you get a new one.

---

#### **Step 4: Getting a New Ticket (Refreshing the Token)**

The next time you come to the park, or when your Golden Ticket expires, you’ll have to go back to the ticket counter (login page) to get a **new Golden Ticket** (a new token). If the park staff remembers you and you still meet the requirements (like having a season pass or having paid), they will give you a new ticket without much hassle. This is like using a **refresh token** to quickly get a new JWT token without logging in again.


## MOONGOSE SCHEMA 


![23. Authentication, JWT & Cookies-20241020080632625.webp](../../../Images/23.%20Authentication,%20JWT%20&%20Cookies-20241020080632625.webp)
->So the task of creating a JWT Token is very subjective because the user id is different for everyone!
Using **schema methods** in Mongoose (or similar ORM/ODM libraries) is considered a good practice for several reasons, particularly in structuring your data models and making your application more maintainable and efficient. Here’s why:

### 1. **Encapsulation of Logic**

- **What it means**: Schema methods allow you to encapsulate business logic related to a specific model directly within that model. This keeps your code organized and focused, as all the operations and behaviors related to the model are defined in one place.
### 2. **Reusability and DRY Principle**

- **What it means**: "DRY" stands for **Don't Repeat Yourself**, and schema methods help you achieve that by allowing you to reuse the same piece of logic in different parts of your application without duplicating code.
- **Example**: If you often check a user's permissions before performing certain actions, you can define a method like `user.hasPermission()`. This method can then be used across different controllers or services rather than rewriting the permission check logic multiple times.

### 3. **Improved Readability and Clean Code**

- **What it means**: By placing commonly used methods inside the schema, you make the code more readable and intuitive. Developers working on the codebase can easily understand the functionality related to a model by just inspecting the schema, rather than searching through various files.
- **Example**: When you need to update a user’s last login time, instead of scattering that logic throughout your app, you can call a method like `user.updateLastLogin()`.
### 4. **Consistency Across the Application**
### 5. **Maintaining Separation of Concerns**
### 6. **Easy Testing**
### 7. **Code Reusability and Modularity**


```javascript
userSchema.methods.getJWT= async function () {
