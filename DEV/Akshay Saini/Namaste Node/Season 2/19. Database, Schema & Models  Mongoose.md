## MONGOOSE LIBRARY
->Mongoose is a popular Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

`mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://souravrajvi18:aCD0N36GNcAc3jDY@namastenode.jeegp.mongodb.net/');`
-> This Returns a promise so it kinda makes sense to use async/await with this!

-> The correct order is typically to **connect to the database first**, then **start the server**. Here’s a brief explanation of the process:

1. **Connect to the Database**: Establishing a connection to your database is essential because your application needs to interact with the database to retrieve or store data.
    
2. **Start the Server**: Once the database connection is established successfully, you can start the server. This allows your application to handle incoming requests, which may involve querying the database for data or saving data to it.

**JavaScript Snippet**
```javascript

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

  

const connectDB = async () => {

    try {

        await mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://souravrajvi18:aCD0N36GNcAc3jDY@namastenode.jeegp.mongodb.net/devTinder');

    } catch (error) {

        console.log(error);

    }

}

  

module.exports = connectDB;
```
- **Function Declaration**: `connectDB` is an asynchronous function (indicated by `async`) that will handle the connection to the MongoDB database.
    
- **Mongoose Connection**:
    
    - Inside the function, `mongoose.connect()` is called with a MongoDB connection string. This string includes:
        - **User Credentials**: `souravrajvi18:aCD0N36GNcAc3jDY` (username and password).
        - **Cluster Address**: `namastenode.jeegp.mongodb.net`.
        - **Database Name**: `devTinder`.
    - The `await` keyword ensures that the connection attempt completes before moving to the next line of code. If the connection is successful, it proceeds without any issues.
- **Error Handling**:
    
    - If an error occurs during the connection process, it will be caught by the `catch` block, which logs the error to the console. This helps in debugging connection issues.


```javascript
connectDB()
.then(() => {
    console.log("MongoDB connected");
    app.listen(3000, () => {
        console.log("Server has been listening successfully on port 3000");
    });
})
.catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});
```

- **Connecting**: The `connectDB` function is called, which returns a Promise.
- **Using `.then()`**:
    - If the connection is successful, the code inside the `.then()` block executes:
        - It logs `"MongoDB connected"` to indicate a successful connection.
        - The Express application starts listening on port 3000 using `app.listen(3000, ...)`.
        - A callback function logs `"Server has been listening successfully on port 3000"` to confirm that the server is up and running.
- **Using `.catch()`**:
    - If there is an error during the connection, the error is caught in the `.catch()` block, and it logs the error to the console.

-> The order does matter though!

-> Now In the Database design ! We do remember that we'll have A collection of all the users!
-> And before we create a collection I would need to Create The schema of the user!

-> So When we say I'm creating a user schema ,So basically! I'm defining the user!
-> To create this model
-> create another folder in Src named MODEL
-> ![19. Database, Schema & Models  Mongoose-20241018155146090.webp](../../../Images/19.%20Database,%20Schema%20&%20Models%20%20Mongoose-20241018155146090.webp)
-> Ismein object pass karenge!
-> In This object we add the parameters that defines the user!

THIS IS HOW WE DEFINE A SCHEMA
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const userSchema=new mongoose.Schema({

    firstName:{

        type:String
   },
    lastName:{

        type:String
   },
    password:{

        type:String
    },
    age:{

        type:Number
    },
    emailId:{

        type:String

    },
    gender:{
         type:String

    }
})
// AB MODEL BHI TOH CREATE KARNA PADEGA NA
const UserModel=mongoose.model("User",userSchema);
// PEHLE HUMNE LIKHA HAI MODEL KA NAME , THEN SCHEMA 
module.exports=UserModel;
```
----

- `"User"` is the name of the model.
- `UserModel` is a JavaScript object representing that model, which we can use to interact with the database.

### Layman’s Example

Imagine a library where you want to keep track of all the books.

1. **The Blueprint**:
    
    - You have a **"Book Schema"** that acts as a _blueprint_ for each book record. It defines what information each book should have, like title, author, and publication date.
2. **The Record Book**:
    
    - Now, you create a **"Books Record Book"** where every entry follows the structure laid out in your "Book Schema." This record book lets you easily add, find, and update information about each book in the library.

In this case:

- `"User"` is like naming the record book _“User”_.
- `UserModel` is the _actual record book_ itself. It allows you to add users, find users, update user info, etc.

So, `UserModel` is a _tool_ you use to interact with your “User” data in the database, following the structure defined by `userSchema`.

------


`const UserModel = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);`

**Creating a Model**:

- This line of code is creating a **Mongoose model** named `UserModel`. A model is like a tool or blueprint that allows us to interact with a specific collection in our MongoDB database.

**Arguments of `mongoose.model`**:

- The `mongoose.model()` function takes two arguments:
    - **First Argument ("User")**: This is the name of the model. By convention, Mongoose will look for a collection in the database with the name that is the plural of this string. In this case, it will look for a collection named `users`.
    - **Second Argument (userSchema)**: This is the schema that we defined earlier. The schema outlines what data the collection will store and the structure of that data (like which fields are required, their data types, etc.).

**Assigning to `UserModel`**:

- The result of `mongoose.model()` is assigned to the constant `UserModel`. This means that `UserModel` now represents the `User` model and can be used to perform operations on the `users` collection in the database, such as:
    - **Creating** new user entries.
    - **Reading** existing user entries.
    - **Updating** user entries.
    - **Deleting** user entries.

### The Role of "User"

1. **Model Name**:
    
    - The string `"User"` is the name you give to the model. This name helps you reference this model in your application code. It’s like a label or identifier for the model.
2. **Collection Naming**:
    
    - Mongoose automatically uses this model name to determine the name of the corresponding collection in the MongoDB database. By convention, Mongoose converts the model name to lowercase and pluralizes it.
    - So:
        - Model Name: `"User"`
        - Corresponding Collection Name in MongoDB: `users`
    - This means that all the documents related to users will be stored in the `users` collection.

### Usage in Code

When you use `mongoose.model("User", userSchema)`, here’s what happens:

- You're creating a model that allows you to interact with the `users` collection in the database.
- Whenever you reference `UserModel` in your code, you are essentially working with the `"User"` model.


```javascript
const UserModel = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
module.exports = UserModel;

```

### What Are We Exporting?

1. **UserModel**:
    
    - `UserModel` is the variable that holds the Mongoose model created by calling `mongoose.model("User", userSchema)`.
    - This model serves as a blueprint for interacting with the `users` collection in your MongoDB database.
2. **Instance of the Model**:
    
    - When you export `UserModel`, you are exporting the actual Mongoose model instance that allows you to perform database operations related to users. This includes methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user documents.

### Practical Example of What This Means

By exporting `UserModel`, you make it available for other parts of your application. For instance:

- In another file, you might do something like this:

Understanding it with the help of a post API!


```javascript
const express = require("express");
const User = require("./models/user");
const connectDB = require('./config/database');
const app=express();
app.post("/signup", async(req,res)=>{
  const user= new User({
    firstName:"Sourav",
    lastName:"Rajvi",
    age:24,
    emailId:"souravrajvi18@gmail.com",
    gender:"male",
    password:"sourav123",
  });
try{

    await user.save();
    res.send("User added  successfully")
  }catch(error){
       res.status(500),send("ERROR AGYA BHAI");
  }
});
connectDB()
.then(()=>{
console.log("MongoDB connected");
app.listen(3000,()=>{
console.log("Server has been listeing sucessfully listeing to port 3000");
});
})
.catch((error)=>{
console.log(error);
});
```
