To use two separate collections in the Tinder-like application is rooted in **good database design principles**.
### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

In database design, it's a best practice to separate different types of data into different collections (or tables in relational databases). This makes it easier to manage, query, and maintain the data over time. Let's break it down:

#### **User Collection (User Schema)**

- This collection is solely responsible for storing **user-related information** such as:
    - Username, email, password (hashed)
    - Personal details (age, gender, bio, photos, etc.)
    - Preferences (e.g., location, interests, match preferences)

Each user is an entity with its own distinct data model, which is static in the sense that user attributes don't change based on connections or interactions with other users.

#### 2.**Connection Requests/Relationships Collection**

- This collection handles **relationships or interactions between users** (like connection requests, matches, rejections, etc.). It could store information such as:
    - User A sends a connection request to User B
    - User B accepts or rejects the request
    - Whether User A and User B are matched, blocked, or connected
    - Timestamps of when requests were sent/accepted/declined

The key here is that the **relationship** between users (A and B) is a distinct entity of its own. It has a dynamic nature, unlike the static user profile data

### 3. **Why Separate Schemas for Users and Connections?**

- **Encapsulation of Logic**: The two entities (users and connections) have completely different properties and functions. A user profile represents a person with personal details, while a connection represents a **relationship** between two users. By separating them into different collections, you encapsulate each type of logic in its own schema.
    
- **Prevent Interference**: If you store both user information and connection details in the same collection, it can create complications. For example:
    
    - Updating a user's profile could unintentionally interfere with their relationships.
    - Matching logic might become more complex, as you'd need to query through large amounts of data (both user info and connection data).
- **Simplifies Queries**: When you need to retrieve **user-specific data**, you query the user collection. When you need to retrieve **relationship or connection data**, you query the connection collection. This keeps your queries more efficient and simplifies indexing and search.
    
- **Modular and Scalable**: This approach allows your application to scale more easily. As the number of users grows, you can manage relationships or connections in a separate collection without bloating the user data. It also allows you to introduce new types of relationships or interactions (like blocking, super-likes, etc.) without affecting the core user schema

### 4. **Why Should Connections Have Their Own Schema?**

A **connection** between two users has its own unique set of properties. Let’s break it down using an analogy:

- **User A** and **User B** are like two individual boxes (representing user documents in the database).
- The **connection** between A and B is like a **rope** that ties them together. This rope (connection) has its own properties:
    - Who initiated the connection?
    - Is the connection mutual (both have swiped right)?
    - What is the current status (pending, accepted, rejected)?
    - Any timestamps related to the connection.

This "rope" (relationship) is its own object with a distinct lifecycle, independent of the users it connects. If you tried to store this data inside the user collection:

- It would mix unrelated data together.
- It would make it hard to query relationships (you’d have to dive deep into each user’s document).
- The structure would become less flexible and harder to scale.

### 5. **Flexibility for Future Changes**

By using separate schemas, you future-proof your application. If you decide to:

- Add more connection types (e.g., blocks, friend requests, etc.).
- Change how connections are tracked.
- Introduce new features like friend groups or connection history.

You can do so without having to redesign your entire user schema. Each schema evolves independently.

## SCHEMA VALIDATION 
### 1. `schema.pre("save")` Function

- **Explanation**: This refers to a Mongoose middleware function that is executed before a document is saved to the database. It allows you to perform operations like validation, transformation, or logging before the actual save occurs.


```javascript
connectionRequestSchema.pre("save",function(next){
const connectionRequest=this;
  if(connectionRequest.fromUserId.equals(connectionRequest.toUserId)){
    throw new Error("Same ID");
  }
  next();
});

```

!Before Saving this is going to run Feels like a middleware to me!






## **HOW TO PUT INDEX IN MY DATABASE**

### Indexing in MongoDB

Indexes in MongoDB are **special data structures** that store a small portion of the collection's data in an easily searchable form. These are used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations, similar to indexes in books. Without indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to find the matching documents, which can be inefficient, especially in large collections.

### Why Use Indexes?

Indexes help MongoDB efficiently search for and retrieve data. If you don't use indexes, MongoDB will perform a **collection scan** (full scan of all documents) when querying, which can become slow as the collection grow

### Key Concepts

1. **Single Field Index**: Indexing based on one field of the document.
2. **Compound Index**: Indexing on multiple fields in a single query.
3. **Unique Index**: Ensures that no two documents in a collection have the same value for the indexed field.
4. **Multikey Index**: Used for arrays, where MongoDB creates an index entry for each element of the array.
5. **Text Index**: Supports text searches for strings within the document.
6. **TTL Index**: Automatically removes documents after a specified period (Time To Live).
### Creating Indexes in MongoDB

To create an index, you use the `createIndex()` method. You specify the fields you want to index and whether the index should be ascending (`1`) or descending (`-1`)
