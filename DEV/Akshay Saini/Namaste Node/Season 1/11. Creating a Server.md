->Server As a word is very Loosely used why because 
-> It can be used for hardware, software or applications .
### 1. **Server as Hardware**:

When referring to **hardware**, a **server** is a physical machine (or a set of machines) designed to process and respond to requests from clients. This is typically a powerful computer dedicated to managing resources and providing services to other computers over a network.

- **Purpose**: Servers, in this sense, are built for continuous operation and high availability. They often have more powerful CPUs, more memory, and storage compared to regular consumer computers, as they must handle multiple, simultaneous client requests.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - **Web Server Hardware**: This is a physical machine where websites and web applications are hosted. When you access a website, you’re essentially making a request to a server's hardware to retrieve and display data.
    - **Database Server Hardware**: This is a machine dedicated to storing and managing databases that applications or users can query.

### 2. **Server as Software or Application**:

In the **software or application** context, a **server** refers to a program or software that processes requests from clients and provides them with services or data. Here, the server doesn’t have to be tied to a specific piece of hardware; it can run on any machine, including cloud infrastructure.

- **Purpose**: Server software listens for client requests, processes them, and sends back appropriate responses. This interaction usually follows a client-server model, where multiple clients (users or devices) send requests to the server.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - **Web Server Software**: Software like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft's IIS that responds to HTTP requests from browsers or applications. When a user types a URL, the web server software handles the request and delivers the web page content.
    - **Application Server**: Software that runs backend processes for a particular service or business logic. For instance, an application server might handle the logic of an e-commerce website.
    - **Database Server Software**: Programs like MySQL or PostgreSQL, which process queries sent by client applications and return the requested data.

In this context, the server refers to the **software** that fulfills client requests, not the physical machine it's running on. In fact, multiple software servers (e.g., web server, database server) can run on the same physical hardware.
### Why is "Server" Used Loosely?

The term **"server"** is used loosely because it refers to both **physical hardware** and **software applications** that serve client requests. In practice:

- A **hardware server** is a physical machine designed to host one or more services (like websites, databases, or applications).
- A **software server** is a program running on either a dedicated physical server or a shared machine (even virtualized environments like cloud servers) to fulfill client requests

->When you say **"we've taken servers on AWS (Amazon Web Services)"**, it generally means that you have provisioned or rented **virtual machines** or **cloud infrastructure** from AWS to run your applications, websites, or services. These "servers" on AWS can refer to both **virtualized hardware resources** and **server software** running on those virtual machines.

### 1. **Virtual Machines (Virtual Servers)**:

On AWS, you are typically using **virtual servers** rather than physical hardware. AWS allows you to create and manage these virtual servers through a service called **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**.

- **What is a Virtual Server?** A virtual server, also known as an instance, is a **software emulation of a physical server**. AWS allocates resources like CPU, memory, and storage from its physical servers (hardware) in its data centers, and these resources are bundled together into virtual machines (VMs). These virtual machines function like physical servers but are hosted in the cloud.
    
- **Why Virtual, Not Physical?** AWS uses virtualization technology to offer flexible, scalable, and on-demand computing resources. Instead of renting a physical machine, you can quickly spin up virtual machines that fit your needs. You can easily increase or decrease the number of virtual servers based on demand (scaling up or down).
-
### 2. **Server Software**:

When you say "servers on AWS," you might also refer to the **server software** that is running on these virtual instances.

- **Web Server Software**: You can run web server software (like Apache, Nginx, etc.) on EC2 instances to host websites or applications.
- **Application Server Software**: This can include running your backend services, APIs, or business logic on the server. For example, Node.js or Java-based servers can be deployed on AWS EC2 instances.
- **Database Servers**: You can run database servers like MySQL or PostgreSQL on EC2 or use managed database services like **RDS** (Amazon Relational Database Service) for more automation.![784](../../../Images/11.%20Creating%20a%20Server-20241015121409453.webp)

## WHAT IS A PROTOCOL?
![11. Creating a Server-20241015122305776.webp](../../../Images/11.%20Creating%20a%20Server-20241015122305776.webp)
An **HTTP server** is a software or system that handles requests made using the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**, which is the foundation of data communication on the web. Its main job is to accept incoming **HTTP requests** (usually from web browsers) and respond with the appropriate **HTTP responses** (like delivering web pages or other resources).
###  **What Does an HTTP Server Do?**

- When you type a website’s URL into your browser (e.g., `www.example.com`), your browser sends an **HTTP request** to the server that hosts the website.
- The **HTTP server** receives this request, processes it, and sends back the appropriate **HTTP response**.
    - If the request is for a webpage, the server sends back the HTML content of the webpage.
    - If the request is for an image or file, the server sends back that specific resource.

The server might also respond with **error messages** (like a "404 Not Found" page) if something goes wrong.
The main difference between **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and **HTTPS** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is **security**. While both are protocols used for transferring data over the web, **HTTPS** includes an additional layer of encryption to protect the data being transmitted.

-> **HTTP** is a protocol used specifically for transmitting web content (like webpages), **TCP/IP** is a suite of communication protocols that defines how data moves across networks

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is a crucial part of how the internet works. It acts like a phonebook for the internet, translating human-readable domain names (like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to communicate with each other.
### **How DNS Works**:

When you type a domain name into your browser, a series of steps take place:

#### a. **DNS Query**:

1. **Browser Cache**: First, the browser checks its own cache to see if it has recently resolved that domain. If it finds a match, it uses that IP address.
    
2. **Operating System Cache**: If the browser doesn’t have it, the request goes to the operating system’s DNS cache.
    
3. **DNS Resolver**: If the IP address is not found in the cache, the request is sent to a DNS resolver (usually provided by your Internet Service Provider). This resolver is responsible for finding the IP address.
#### b. **DNS Hierarchy**:

4. **Root Name Server**: If the resolver doesn’t have the IP address cached, it queries a root name server, which knows where to find the top-level domain (TLD) servers (e.g., .com, .org).
    
5. **TLD Name Server**: The root server directs the resolver to the appropriate TLD name server. For example, if you're looking for [www.example.com](http://www.example.com), the resolver will contact the .com TLD name server.
    
6. **Authoritative Name Server**: The TLD name server then points to the authoritative name server for the specific domain. This server contains the actual DNS records for that domain, including its corresponding IP address.
    

#### c. **Response**:

7. **Return IP Address**: The authoritative server returns the IP address to the DNS resolver, which then caches this information for future requests and sends the IP address back to your browser.
    
8. **Accessing the Website**: Finally, your browser can now use the IP address to access the website.

Keeping the frontend, backend, and database on the same AWS server is technically possible, but it can lead to several challenges, especially as your application grows. Here are a few potential issues:

### 1. **Scalability**

- **Limited Resources**: A single server will have limited CPU, memory, and storage. As traffic increases, this server may become a bottleneck, causing slow performance or downtime.
- **No Horizontal Scaling**: With all components on the same server, it is difficult to scale individual parts of your system (like the backend or database) separately. You would need to scale the entire server, which may be inefficient.

### 2. **Performance**

- **Resource Contention**: If the frontend, backend, and database are competing for the same server's resources (CPU, RAM), it could degrade performance, especially if one component uses more resources than others.
- **Latency**: While keeping everything on one server may reduce network latency between components, it can cause performance degradation due to high local resource usage when there’s heavy traffic or multiple requests.

### 3. **Fault Tolerance**

- **Single Point of Failure**: If the server goes down, the entire application (frontend, backend, and database) will go down with it, resulting in a complete outage.
- **No Redundancy**: Having everything on one server means there’s no backup or failover system. If any part of the server experiences issues, all components will be affected.

### 4. **Security**

- **Less Isolation**: Hosting the frontend, backend, and database on the same server reduces isolation between components, increasing the risk that if one part is compromised, the entire system could be at risk.
- **Exposed Attack Surface**: If the frontend and backend share the same machine, securing public endpoints becomes more complicated, and misconfiguration might expose sensitive parts of your app.

### 5. **Maintenance and Upgrades**

- **Complex Updates**: Updating the server could affect all parts of your application, making maintenance more complex and increasing the risk of downtime during updates.
- **Downtime**: Any time you need to perform server maintenance, the entire application will go offline.

### 6. **Cost Efficiency**

- Initially, a single server might seem cost-effective, but as your application grows, scaling and maintaining a single large server could become more expensive than splitting the services across multiple smaller servers that you can scale individually.
o avoid these issues, it's recommended to separate concerns, such as:

- **Frontend**: Host on AWS S3 with CloudFront for distribution (if it's a static website).
- **Backend**: Deploy on EC2, AWS Lambda, or ECS depending on your architecture.
- **Database**: Use managed services like Amazon RDS or DynamoDB to ensure performance and scalability without manually managing it.

-> In large companies, the architecture is often distributed across multiple servers rather than relying on a single server. This approach helps manage different aspects of the application efficiently and ensures scalability, reliability, and performance.

## Socket vs WebSockets

### 1. **Socket (Traditional Sockets)**

#### Overview:

- **Socket** is a lower-level communication endpoint for network communication, allowing data to be sent and received over a network.
- Traditional sockets are based on the **TCP/IP** or **UDP** protocols.

#### How it Works:

- **TCP/IP** sockets use a connection-oriented approach, where a connection is established between a client and a server. Once connected, they can exchange data until the connection is closed.
- **UDP** sockets use a connectionless approach, meaning there’s no persistent connection. Data (called datagrams) is sent without ensuring whether the data is received or the order of data.

### 2. **WebSocket**

#### Overview:

- **WebSocket** is a higher-level protocol designed for **full-duplex communication** (bi-directional), which allows a client and server to send and receive data continuously over a single connection.
- It is built over the TCP protocol but is specifically optimized for web communication.

#### How it Works:

- WebSockets start with an **HTTP handshake** and then upgrade the connection to a WebSocket. Once established, the connection remains open, allowing **real-time**, continuous communication between the client and server.
- Both the client and server can send data anytime without needing to establish a new connection, providing an interactive, low-latency experience.
