A **DBMS** (Database Management System) is software that allows you to **create, manage, and manipulate databases**. It handles the interaction between applications and the actual data stored in the database, ensuring that data is stored securely, efficiently, and can be retrieved and updated as needed.

### Key Functions of a DBMS:

1. **Data Storage**: Organizes data in a structured way (usually in tables or other data formats like documents or graphs).
2. **Data Retrieval**: Allows you to search, query, and retrieve data from the database using a query language (like SQL).
3. **Data Manipulation**: Enables inserting, updating, or deleting data in the database.
4. **Transaction Management**: Ensures data integrity during operations like inserts, updates, or deletes (e.g., if one part fails, the system rolls back to avoid data corruption).
5. **Access Control**: Manages who can access or modify data, ensuring security.
6. **Data Integrity**: Ensures the accuracy and consistency of data.
7. **Backup and Recovery**: Handles data backup and restoration in case of data loss or corruption.

### Examples of DBMS:

1. **MySQL**: A popular open-source relational database management system used widely for web applications.
2. **PostgreSQL**: An advanced open-source relational database with a strong emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance.
3. **Microsoft SQL Server**: A relational DBMS developed by Microsoft, often used for enterprise applications.
4. **Oracle Database**: A commercial relational database known for its performance and enterprise features.
5. **MongoDB**: A NoSQL DBMS that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format (BSON), making it easier to handle large volumes of unstructured data.
6. **SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based relational DBMS often used in mobile applications.

A **raw database** refers to the **storage layer** where data is held in its basic form, without any complex management or manipulation systems on top of it. It’s the fundamental data storage, like files or simple storage systems, where the data is not organized, structured, or queried in an advanced manner like with a **DBMS**.
Examples:
- **Flat Files** (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML)
    
    - Example: `data.csv` storing rows of information in plain text.
- **Key-Value Storage**
    
    - Example: Directory of text files (`file1.txt` with "name=John, age=25, city=New York").
- **Amazon S3** (Object Storage)
    
    - Example: `s3://my-bucket/data-file1.json` storing files as objects in the cloud.
- **Hadoop HDFS** (Hadoop Distributed File System)
    
    - Example: `/user/hadoop/logs/log1.txt` storing large datasets across multiple machines.
- **Binary Files**
    
    - Example: `model_weights.bin` storing raw binary data for applications like machine learning models.
### 1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**:

- **What it is**: A cloud service that provides **virtual servers (instances)** to run applications. It’s basically a virtual machine you can rent on AWS to run software, host websites, or handle computational tasks.
- **Key Use**: EC2 is used for running applications, web servers, databases, or custom software environments.
- **Example**: You can launch an EC2 instance (like a virtual Linux or Windows server) and install software, manage databases, or host applications.

EC2 is a compute service, meaning it provides the power to run applications but doesn’t inherently store large amounts of data on its own. However, you can attach storage (like EBS volumes) or integrate with S3 for data storage.
### 2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) Bucket**:

- **What it is**: S3 is a **storage service** used to store and retrieve any amount of data (files, media, backups, etc.). An **S3 bucket** is like a container where you store your objects (files) in S3.
- **Key Use**: It’s used for storing large files, backups, media assets, or any data you need to access globally. It’s highly durable and scalable.
- **Example**: You can store files like `data.json`, `photo.jpg`, or backups like `db_backup.sql` in an S3 bucket and access them from anywhere.
#### How They Can Work Together:

- You might use **EC2** to run a web application or database.
- You could use **S3** to store static assets, backups, or large datasets that your EC2 instance accesses.
### AMAZON RDS
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is not just a Database Management System (DBMS); it is a managed database service that simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of relational databases in the cloud.
**Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** is a managed database service from AWS that allows you to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It automates common administrative tasks like provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, and scaling, making it easier for users to run databases without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.

### Key Features of Amazon RDS:

1. **Managed Service**: RDS handles database management tasks such as backups, software patching, monitoring, and scaling, which means users don't need to worry about infrastructure-level management.
    
2. **Supports Multiple Database Engines**: RDS supports popular relational database engines, including:
    
    - **MySQL**
    - **PostgreSQL**
    - **MariaDB**
    - **Oracle**
    - **Microsoft SQL Server**
    - **Amazon Aurora** (a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible database engine optimized by AWS)
3. **Automated Backups and Snapshots**: RDS automatically creates backups of your database, stores them in Amazon S3, and can restore databases from these backups when needed.
    
4. **High Availability and Failover**: With the **Multi-AZ** (Multi-Availability Zone) deployment option, RDS provides high availability by replicating data to a standby instance in another availability zone, ensuring minimal downtime.
    
5. **Scalability**: RDS allows users to easily scale database instances (increase compute, memory, or storage) without downtime, which is crucial for applications with fluctuating workloads.
    
6. **Security**: RDS offers encryption at rest and in transit, integration with **AWS IAM** (Identity and Access Management) for access control, and **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud) to isolate database instances.
    
7. **Performance Monitoring**: AWS provides performance insights and metrics that help optimize database performance and diagnose slow queries.

### RDS vs. EC2 for Databases:

- **RDS**: Fully managed; AWS handles most database management tasks, including scaling, backups, and patching.
- **EC2**: You have to manage everything yourself when running a database on an EC2 instance, from installation to patching and backups.

### Example:

If you need to run a **PostgreSQL** database for an e-commerce website, instead of installing and managing the database on your own using **Amazon EC2**, you can use **Amazon RDS** to create a PostgreSQL database that automatically handles backups, patches, and scaling, allowing you to focus on your application instead of infrastructure.


### Database Engine

- **Definition**: A database engine is a core component of a DBMS that handles the actual data storage, retrieval, and processing. It is the underlying technology that implements the database functionalities.
1. **MySQL**: An open-source relational database management system known for its speed and reliability. It is widely used for web applications.
    
2. **PostgreSQL**: An open-source object-relational database system that emphasizes extensibility and standards compliance. It supports advanced data types and performance optimization features.
    
3. **MariaDB**: A fork of MySQL, created by the original developers of MySQL. It aims to maintain compatibility with MySQL while adding new features and improvements.
    
4. **Oracle**: A commercial relational database management system known for its robustness, scalability, and comprehensive features for enterprise applications.
    
5. **Microsoft SQL Server**: A relational database management system developed by Microsoft, offering a range of tools for data management, business intelligence, and analytics.


- A **DBMS** is a broader term that encompasses all aspects of database management software, including the database engine.
- A **database engine** is a specific part of a DBMS that deals with the low-level data handling and processing.


### What is a DBMS?

- **MongoDB as a DBMS**:
    - MongoDB is a NoSQL DBMS that allows you to store, retrieve, and manage data in a flexible, document-oriented format. It provides capabilities for data modeling, querying, and indexing, among other features.
    - As a DBMS, MongoDB provides the fundamental tools for data management but requires you to handle the infrastructure and operational tasks if you are self-managing it.

### Self-Managed MongoDB vs. MongoDB Atlas

- **Self-Managed MongoDB**:
    
    - You are responsible for every aspect of the database, including provisioning servers, installing and configuring the database software, managing backups, scaling, implementing security measures, and monitoring performance.
    - This requires significant time, expertise, and effort, as you have to manage everything from hardware to software updates.
- **MongoDB Atlas**:
    
    - While it uses MongoDB as the underlying DBMS, Atlas takes care of all the operational tasks, making it a fully managed service.
    - You still benefit from all the features of MongoDB, but you offload the complexities of managing the infrastructure and operations to Atlas.
    - Atlas automates tasks like provisioning, backups, scaling, high availability, security, and monitoring, allowing developers to focus on building applications rather than managing the database.

**Amazon DynamoDB** is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services). It is designed to handle high-traffic applications with low-latency performance and provides seamless scalability, allowing you to scale up or down as needed. Here's a detailed overview of DynamoDB:

### Key Features of Amazon DynamoDB:

1. **NoSQL Database**:
    
    - DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a key-value format, allowing for flexible schema design. This makes it suitable for applications that require rapid development and iteration.
2. **Fully Managed Service**:
    
    - As a fully managed service, AWS handles all the administrative tasks, such as hardware provisioning, setup, configuration, scaling, and backups. This reduces the operational overhead for developers and allows them to focus on building applications.
3. **Performance and Scalability**:
    
    - DynamoDB is designed for high throughput and low latency, providing consistent performance even at scale. It can automatically scale up or down based on demand, handling millions of requests per second with ease.
4. **High Availability**:
    
    - DynamoDB automatically replicates data across multiple servers and data centers within an AWS region, ensuring high availability and durability. It offers a service-level agreement (SLA) for 99.99% availability.
5. **Flexible Data Models**:
    
    - You can define your data structure using tables, items (analogous to rows), and attributes (analogous to columns). This flexibility allows you to work with semi-structured or unstructured data.
6. **Built-in Security**:
    
    - DynamoDB integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control. It also supports encryption at rest and in transit to protect your data.
7. **Global Tables**:
    
    - With DynamoDB global tables, you can create multi-region, fully replicated tables that allow you to serve global applications with low-latency access to data.
8. **DynamoDB Streams**:
    
    - This feature captures changes to items in your DynamoDB table and can trigger AWS Lambda functions or other actions in response to these changes, enabling event-driven architectures.
9. **Cost-Effective**:
    
    - DynamoDB offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model based on the amount of data stored and the read/write capacity consumed, making it cost-effective for many use cases.

IN A CLUSTER WE CAN HAVE MULTIPLE SEPERATE DATABASES!

DATABASE-> COLLECTION->DOCUMENT->FIELD 

-> Every time you install a Node.js package, it gets installed into the `node_modules` folder by default. This happens when you run the command `npm install <package-name>` or just `npm install` (which installs all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file).

Here's how it works:

- **Global installation** (`npm install -g <package-name>`): The package is installed globally and can be accessed from anywhere on your system. These packages are not placed in your local project's `node_modules` but rather in a global directory.
    
- **Local installation** (`npm install <package-name>`): The package is installed locally to your project, inside the `node_modules` folder. This allows the package to be used only within that project.
    

The `node_modules` folder contains all the dependencies of your project, along with their dependencies, creating a nested structure.

hen you install a Node.js package, the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files are updated in the following ways:

### 1. **`package.json`**:

- **Dependencies Update**: When you install a package (e.g., `npm install <package-name> --save` or simply `npm install <package-name>`), the package is added to the `dependencies` section of `package.json`. This file tracks the list of packages your project depends on.
    - Example:
        
      
        
        `{   "dependencies": {     "express": "^4.17.1"   } }`
        
    - If you use the `--save-dev` flag (e.g., `npm install <package-name> --save-dev`), the package will be added to the `devDependencies` section instead, meaning it's used for development purposes only.
    - Example:
        
        
        
        
        
        `{   "devDependencies": {     "eslint": "^7.32.0"   } }`
        

### 2. **`package-lock.json`**:

- **Exact Version Lock**: The `package-lock.json` file ensures that all installed packages (and their dependencies) are locked to a specific version. This file is automatically generated when you install packages, and it includes the exact versions of each package, even nested dependencies.
    - Example entry:
        
	
``` json
        "express": {   
         "version": "4.17.1",  
         "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.17.1.tgz",   
         "integrity": "sha512-xxxx",   
         "dependencies": {     "accepts": "^1.3.7",     "array-flatten": "^1.1.1"   } 
         }
        ```

        
    - This file helps ensure consistency across different environments (e.g., your local machine and a production server) by installing the exact same versions of dependencies.


-> Including `node_modules` in your `.gitignore` file is a common practice for several important reasons:
### 1. **Large Size**:

- The `node_modules` directory can contain thousands of files and subdirectories, depending on the number of dependencies your project has. Pushing all these files to a Git repository would drastically increase the size of the repository, making it harder to manage, clone, or update.

### 2. **Reproducibility**:

- The actual contents of the `node_modules` folder can differ slightly depending on the operating system, Node.js version, or even different installation times. By ignoring `node_modules`, you're ensuring that everyone working on the project installs the exact versions of dependencies listed in `package-lock.json` or `package.json`, which ensures consistency across environments.

### 3. **Generated/Restorable Files**:

- The `node_modules` folder is not unique or necessary to store in version control because it can easily be recreated. Once someone clones your repository, they can run `npm install`, which will automatically install the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

-> `npm install` is a command used in Node.js projects to install the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file, or to install a specific package into the project. It serves a couple of purposes depending on the context in which it's used:

### 1. **Installing All Dependencies** (`npm install` without arguments):

- When you run `npm install` without specifying a package, it looks for the `package.json` file in your project and installs all the dependencies (and devDependencies) listed under the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections.
- It also creates (or updates) a `node_modules` folder where all the dependencies and their sub-dependencies are stored.
- If a `package-lock.json` file exists, `npm install` ensures that the exact versions specified in `package-lock.json` are installed, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### 2. **Installing a Specific Package** (`npm install <package-name>`):

- If you specify a package name, for example, `npm install express`, it installs the package and adds it to your `node_modules` directory.
- By default, this command also updates the `package.json` file, adding the package to the `dependencies` section. You can prevent this by using the `--no-save` flag.

### 3. **Options for Installation**:

- **Save as a dependency (`--save`)**: This is the default behavior. The package is added to the `dependencies` section of `package.json`.
    - Command: `npm install <package-name>`
- **Save as a devDependency (`--save-dev`)**: This is used when the package is needed only for development (e.g., testing, linting, or build tools). The package is added to the `devDependencies` section of `package.json`.
    - Command: `npm install <package-name> --save-dev`
- **Global installation (`-g`)**: This installs the package globally on your machine so that it can be used in any project or directly from the command line.
    - Command: `npm install -g <package-name>`

### 4. **Installing Specific Versions**:

- You can install a specific version of a package using:
    
    `npm install <package-name>@<version>`
    
- For example, to install version 4.17.1 of `express`, you would run:
    
    `npm install express@4.17.1`


HOW TO CONNECT TO OUR DATABASE 

``` javascript
const {MongoClient} = require('mongoose');
```

When you use `const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');`, the `mongodb` package exports multiple components, not just a single object. Specifically, it exports several classes and functions, among which `MongoClient` is one of them.
#### Key Components of the `mongodb` Package

1. **MongoClient Class**:
    
    - Used for connecting to a MongoDB server and performing operations on the database.
    - Contains methods for managing connections.
2. **Db Class**:
    
    - Represents a specific database in MongoDB.
3. **Collection Class**:
    
    - Represents a collection within a database.
4. **Cursor Class**:
    
    - Used to iterate over the results of a query.
5. **Various Utility Functions and Types**:
    
    - Includes types like `ObjectId`, `Binary`, and others for working with specific data types in MongoDB.

In Production Level we don't use mongodb package!


```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// or as an es module:

// import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb'

  

// Connection URL

const url = 'mongodb+srv://souravrajvi18:aCD0N36GNcAc3jDY@namastenode.jeegp.mongodb.net/';

const client = new MongoClient(url);

  

// Database Name

const dbName = 'testing';

  

async function main() {

  // Use connect method to connect to the server

  await client.connect();

  console.log('Connected successfully to server');

  const db = client.db(dbName);

  const collection = db.collection('movie');

  

  // the following code examples can be pasted here...

  const data={

    name:"fury"

  };

  const insertResult = await collection.insertMany([data]);

console.log('Inserted documents =>', insertResult);

  

  return 'done.';

}

  

main()

  .then(console.log)

  .catch(console.error)

  .finally(() => client.close());
```
