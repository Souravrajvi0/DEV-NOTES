Up until now, our discussions have primarily revolved around the backend architecture. In this lecture, Harkirat takes a `practical approach` by guiding us through the hands-on process of `building the frontend of the application.` We'll be applying the knowledge we've gained so far, specifically focusing on implementing the frontend using `React` and the backend using `Node.js`, `MongoDB`, and `Express` â€” creating a classic `MERN` stack application.

> While there are `no specific notes` provided for this section, a mini guide is outlined below to assist you in navigating through the process of building the application. Therefore, it is strongly `advised to actively follow along` during the lecture for a hands-on learning experience.

  

  

# Learning Outcomes

While building the frontend we will also gain a deeper understanding of the backend architecture of the application. In the process of adding real time feature for our application we will also understand the implementation of web sockets. Github Repository In case you wish to follow along:
