# Testing in Node.js + Express

Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, and it becomes even more important when working with complex applications like those built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. In this section, we'll explore various aspects of testing in Node.js and Express, which forms the backend component of the MERN stack.

![Untitled 49.png](../../../../Images/Untitled%2049.png)

### Understanding Different Types of Tests

Before diving into the specifics of testing in Node.js and Express, it's essential to understand the different types of tests commonly used in software development:

1. **Unit Tests**: Unit tests are low-level tests that focus on testing individual units or components of your application in isolation. In the context of a Node.js + Express application, unit tests might cover individual functions, middleware, or utility modules.
2. **Integration Tests**: Integration tests verify the interaction between different components or modules of your application. For example, in a Node.js + Express application, integration tests might test how different routes, controllers, and services work together.
3. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: End-to-End tests simulate real-world user scenarios by testing the entire application flow, from the user interface to the backend services. In the context of a MERN stack application, E2E tests would involve testing the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js + Express) components together.

### Testing an Express Backend

When it comes to testing an Express backend, there are several tools and libraries available to help you write and run tests effectively. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Jest**: Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It provides a rich set of features for writing and running tests, including mocking, code coverage, and parallel test execution.
2. **Vitest**: Vitest is a newer test runner built by the Vite team. It's designed to be fast, lightweight, and compatible with Jest's API, making it a great alternative for testing Node.js applications.
3. **Supertest**: Supertest is a library that provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP servers, making it easy to test Express routes and middleware.
4. **Mocking and Spying**: When testing Express applications, you often need to mock or spy on certain dependencies, such as databases, external APIs, or other services. Libraries like `jest.mock` or `sinon` can help you create mocks and spies for these dependencies.

Here's an example of how you might test an Express route using Jest and Supertest:

```JavaScript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./app'); // Your Express app

describe('GET /api/users', () => {
  it('should return a list of users', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/api/users');
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body).toHaveLength(2); // Assuming there are 2 users
  });
});
```

In this example, we're using Supertest to send a GET request to the `/api/users` route of our Express app and asserting that the response has a status code of 200 and contains an array of two users.

### Integrating Testing and Coverage in CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for ensuring that your application is thoroughly tested and that any issues are caught early in the development process. Here are some steps you can take to integrate testing and coverage in your CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Configure a CI/CD Tool**: Choose a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Jenkins, and configure it to run your tests whenever code is pushed to your repository.
2. **Run Tests**: In your CI/CD pipeline, include a step to run your unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using the appropriate testing frameworks and tools.
3. **Generate Code Coverage Reports**: Most testing frameworks, like Jest and Vitest, can generate code coverage reports that show which parts of your codebase are covered by tests. Configure your CI/CD pipeline to generate and store these reports.
4. **Set Code Coverage Thresholds**: To ensure that your codebase maintains a certain level of test coverage, you can set code coverage thresholds in your CI/CD pipeline. If the coverage falls below these thresholds, the pipeline can fail, preventing untested code from being deployed.
5. **Integrate with Code Quality Tools**: Consider integrating your CI/CD pipeline with code quality tools like SonarQube or CodeClimate, which can provide additional insights into code quality, technical debt, and potential issues.

By integrating testing and coverage in your CI/CD pipeline, you can catch issues early, ensure that your codebase is thoroughly tested, and maintain a high level of code quality throughout the development process.

The provided code repository (`https://github.com/100xdevs-cohort-2/week-24-testing/`) contains examples and exercises related to testing in Node.js and Express, which can help you further understand and practice these concepts.

  

# Testing a Simple App

In this section, we'll explore how to set up and write tests for a simple TypeScript application using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework.

### Setting up the Project

1. Initialize a new TypeScript project:

```Shell
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
```

1. Update the `tsconfig.json` file to set the `rootDir` and `outDir` properties:

```JSON
"rootDir": "./src",
"outDir": "./dist",
```

This configuration tells TypeScript to treat the `src` directory as the root directory for your source files and output the compiled JavaScript files to the `dist` directory.

1. Create the `src/index.ts` file with a simple `sum` function:

```TypeScript
export function sum(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Setting up Jest

1. Install the required dependencies:

```Shell
npm install --save-dev ts-jest @jest/globals
```

- `ts-jest` is a Jest transformer that allows you to write tests in TypeScript.
- `@jest/globals` provides type definitions for Jest's global variables and functions.

1. Initialize Jest configuration:

```Shell
npx ts-jest config:init
```

This command creates a `jest.config.ts` file with the default Jest configuration for TypeScript projects.

1. Update the `package.json` file to include a test script:

```JSON
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
},
```

### Writing Tests

1. Create a new file `src/index.test.ts` for your tests:

```TypeScript
import { describe, expect, test } from '@jest/globals';
import { sum } from '../index';

describe('sum module', () => {
  test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
});
```

In this example, we import the `sum` function from the `index.ts` file and write a test case that checks if `sum(1, 2)` returns `3`.

- `describe` is a Jest function that groups related tests together.
- `test` (or `it`) is a Jest function that defines an individual test case.
- `expect` is a Jest function that provides assertion utilities for testing.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```Shell
npm run test
```

Jest will automatically find and run all files with the `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension in your project. If the test passes, you should see output similar to the following:

```Plain
 PASS  src/index.test.ts
  sum module
    âœ“ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (2 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.185 s, estimated 1 s
Ran all test suites.
```

This example demonstrates how to set up a simple TypeScript project, configure Jest for testing, and write and run a basic unit test. As your application grows, you can continue adding more test files and test cases to ensure comprehensive test coverage for your codebase.

  

# Testing an Express App

In this section, we'll learn how to test an Express application using Jest and Supertest. We'll create a simple Express server and write tests to ensure its functionality.

### Setting up the Project

1. Initialize a new TypeScript project:

```Shell
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
```

1. Update the `tsconfig.json` file to set the `rootDir` and `outDir` properties:

```JSON
"rootDir": "./src",
"outDir": "./dist",
```

1. Install the required dependencies:

```Shell
npm install --save-dev ts-jest @jest/globals @types/express
npm install supertest @types/supertest
npm install express
```

- `ts-jest` and `@jest/globals`: Required for running Jest tests with TypeScript.
- `@types/express`: TypeScript type definitions for Express.
- `supertest`: A library for testing HTTP servers, including Express apps.
- `@types/supertest`: TypeScript type definitions for Supertest.
- `express`: The Express web framework.

1. Initialize Jest configuration:

```Shell
npx ts-jest config:init
```

1. Update the `package.json` file to include a test script:

```JSON
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
},
```

### Creating the Express Server

1. Create a new file `src/index.ts` and define a simple Express server:

```TypeScript
import express from "express";

export const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/sum", (req, res) => {
    const a = req.body.a;
    const b = req.body.b;
    const answer = a + b;

    res.json({
        answer
    });
});
```

This Express server defines a single route `/sum` that accepts a POST request with two numbers `a` and `b` in the request body, calculates their sum, and returns the result as a JSON response.

### Writing Tests

1. Create a new file `src/tests/sum.test.ts` for your tests:

```TypeScript
import { describe, expect, test, it } from '@jest/globals';
import request from "supertest";
import { app } from "../index";

describe("POST /sum", () => {
    it("should return the sum of two numbers", async () => {
        const res = await request(app).post("/sum").send({
            a: 1,
            b: 2
        });
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
        expect(res.body.answer).toBe(3);
    });

    it("should return the sum of two negative numbers", async () => {
        const res = await request(app).post("/sum").send({
            a: -1,
            b: -2
        });
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
        expect(res.body.answer).toBe(-3);
    });

    it("should return the sum of two zero numbers", async () => {
        const res = await request(app).post("/sum").send({
            a: 0,
            b: 0
        });
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
        expect(res.body.answer).toBe(0);
    });
});
```

In this example, we use Supertest to send POST requests to the `/sum` route with different sets of input numbers. We then assert that the response status code is 200 (OK) and that the `answer` property in the response body matches the expected sum.

1. Update the `jest.config.js` file to specify the test file pattern:

```JavaScript
/** @type {import('ts-jest').JestConfigWithTsJest} */
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  testMatch: ["<rootDir>/src/tests/**/*.ts"]
};
```

This configuration tells Jest to look for test files in the `src/tests` directory and its subdirectories.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```Shell
npm run test
```

Jest will automatically find and run all test files matching the specified pattern. If the tests pass, you should see output similar to the following:

```Plain
 PASS  src/tests/sum.test.ts
  POST /sum
    âœ“ should return the sum of two numbers (10 ms)
    âœ“ should return the sum of two negative numbers (1 ms)
    âœ“ should return the sum of two zero numbers

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.185 s, estimated 1 s
Ran all test suites.
```

This example demonstrates how to test an Express application using Jest and Supertest. By writing tests for your routes and middleware, you can ensure that your application behaves as expected and catch any regressions or issues early in the development process.

  

# Slightly More Complex Endpoint

In this section, we'll enhance our Express application by adding input validation using the Zod library. We'll also add a new GET endpoint for the `/sum` route and write tests to ensure the correct behavior of both the POST and GET endpoints.

### Setting up Zod

1. Install the Zod library:

```Shell
npm install zod
```

1. Update the `src/index.ts` file to include input validation using Zod:

```TypeScript
import express from "express";
import { z } from "zod";

export const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const sumInput = z.object({
    a: z.number(),
    b: z.number()
});

app.post("/sum", (req, res) => {
    const parsedResponse = sumInput.safeParse(req.body);

    if (!parsedResponse.success) {
        return res.status(411).json({
            message: "Incorrect inputs"
        });
    }

    const answer = parsedResponse.data.a + parsedResponse.data.b;

    res.json({
        answer
    });
});

app.get("/sum", (req, res) => {
    const parsedResponse = sumInput.safeParse({
        a: Number(req.headers["a"]),
        b: Number(req.headers["b"])
    });

    if (!parsedResponse.success) {
        return res.status(411).json({
            message: "Incorrect inputs"
        });
    }

    const answer = parsedResponse.data.a + parsedResponse.data.b;

    res.json({
        answer
    });
});
```

In this updated code, we define a Zod schema `sumInput` that validates the input data for the `/sum` route. For the POST endpoint, we use `sumInput.safeParse(req.body)` to validate the request body. For the GET endpoint, we use `sumInput.safeParse({ a: Number(req.headers["a"]), b: Number(req.headers["b"]) })` to validate the input values from the request headers.

If the input data is invalid, we return a 411 (Length Required) status code with an error message. Otherwise, we calculate the sum and return it as a JSON response.

### Updating Tests

Update the `src/tests/sum.test.ts` file to include tests for the new GET endpoint and the input validation:

```TypeScript
import { describe, expect, test, it } from '@jest/globals';
import request from "supertest";
import { app } from "../index";

describe("POST /sum", () => {
    it("should return the sum of two numbers", async () => {
        const res = await request(app).post("/sum").send({
            a: 1,
            b: 2
        });
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
        expect(res.body.answer).toBe(3);
    });

    it("should return 411 if no inputs are provided", async () => {
        const res = await request(app).post("/sum").send({});
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(411);
        expect(res.body.message).toBe("Incorrect inputs");
    });
});

describe("GET /sum", () => {
    it("should return the sum of two numbers", async () => {
        const res = await request(app)
            .get("/sum")
            .set({
                a: "1",
                b: "2"
            })
            .send();
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
        expect(res.body.answer).toBe(3);
    });

    it("should return 411 if no inputs are provided", async () => {
        const res = await request(app)
            .get("/sum").send();
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(411);
    });
});
```

In this updated test file, we add two new test cases for the GET `/sum` endpoint:

- The first test case sends a GET request with valid input values in the request headers and asserts that the response status code is 200 and the `answer` property in the response body matches the expected sum.
- The second test case sends a GET request without any input values and asserts that the response status code is 411 (Length Required) and the `message` property in the response body contains the expected error message.

We also add a new test case for the POST `/sum` endpoint that checks if the server returns a 411 status code and the correct error message when no input data is provided in the request body.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```Shell
npm run test
```

Jest will automatically find and run all test files matching the specified pattern. If the tests pass, you should see output similar to the following:

```Plain
 PASS  src/tests/sum.test.ts
  POST /sum
    âœ“ should return the sum of two numbers (10 ms)
    âœ“ should return 411 if no inputs are provided (1 ms)
  GET /sum
    âœ“ should return the sum of two numbers (1 ms)
    âœ“ should return 411 if no inputs are provided

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       4 passed, 4 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.185 s, estimated 1 s
Ran all test suites.
```

This example demonstrates how to add input validation to an Express application using the Zod library and how to write tests to ensure the correct behavior of the application, including handling invalid input data.

  

  

# Moving from Jest to Vitest

Vitest is a relatively new testing framework that has gained popularity due to its tight integration with Vite, a modern and fast build tool. While Jest has been the de facto standard for testing in JavaScript and TypeScript projects, Vitest offers several advantages, especially for TypeScript projects. In this section, we'll explore the reasons for moving from Jest to Vitest and the benefits it provides.

![Untitled 1 41.png](../../../../Images/Untitled%201%2041.png)

### Benefits of Moving to Vitest

By moving from Jest to Vitest, you can enjoy the following benefits:

1. **Improved Performance**: Vitest's parallelization and tight integration with Vite can lead to significantly faster test execution times, improving your overall development workflow.
2. **Consistent Developer Experience**: With Vitest, you can leverage the same configuration and plugins across your application and tests, providing a consistent developer experience.
3. **Better TypeScript Support**: Vitest's native TypeScript support eliminates the need for additional configuration or plugins, simplifying the setup process for TypeScript projects.
4. **Seamless Integration with Vite**: If you're already using Vite for your project, adopting Vitest ensures a seamless integration and a unified development experience.
5. **Future-proof**: As Vite continues to evolve and gain popularity, Vitest's alignment with Vite positions it as a future-proof testing solution for modern web development.

While Jest remains a powerful and widely adopted testing framework, Vitest's advantages, especially for TypeScript projects and Vite-based workflows, make it a compelling alternative worth considering.

  

> The provided links (`https://vitest.dev/` and `https://vitest.dev/guide/why.html`) offer more detailed information about Vitest, its features, and the rationale behind its creation. These resources can help you better understand the benefits of moving to Vitest and guide you through the migration process if you decide to make the switch.

  

  

# Simple Express Project with Vitest

In this section, we'll set up a simple Express project and configure Vitest as our testing framework. We'll also migrate the existing tests from Jest to Vitest, showcasing the compatibility between the two frameworks.

### Setting up the Express Project

1. Initialize a new Node.js project:

```Shell
npm init -y
```

1. Install the required dependencies:

```Shell
npm install express @types/express zod
```

1. Update the `tsconfig.json` file to set the `rootDir` and `outDir` properties:

```JSON
"rootDir": "./src",
"outDir": "./dist"
```

1. Create the `src/index.ts` file with a simple Express server:

```TypeScript
import express from "express";
import { z } from "zod";

export const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const sumInput = z.object({
    a: z.number(),
    b: z.number()
});

app.post("/sum", (req, res) => {
    const parsedResponse = sumInput.safeParse(req.body);

    if (!parsedResponse.success) {
        return res.status(411).json({
            message: "Incorrect inputs"
        });
    }

    const answer = parsedResponse.data.a + parsedResponse.data.b;

    res.json({
        answer
    });
});

app.get("/sum", (req, res) => {
    const parsedResponse = sumInput.safeParse({
        a: Number(req.headers["a"]),
        b: Number(req.headers["b"])
    });

    if (!parsedResponse.success) {
        return res.status(411).json({
            message: "Incorrect inputs"
        });
    }

    const answer = parsedResponse.data.a + parsedResponse.data.b;

    res.json({
        answer
    });
});
```

Note that we're not calling `app.listen` here, as we don't want the app to start when running tests. Usually, you would create a separate file (e.g., `bin.ts` or `main.ts`) that imports the `app` and starts the server.

### Setting up Vitest

1. Install Vitest as a development dependency:

```Shell
npm install -D vitest
```

1. Add a test script to the `package.json` file:

```JSON
"scripts": {
    "test": "vitest"
},
```

1. Create a simple test file `test/index.test.ts`:

```TypeScript
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'

test('true === true', () => {
  expect(true).toBe(true)
})
```

1. Run the test script:

```Shell
npm run test
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```Plain
 âœ“ true === true (1ms)

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  1 passed (1)
      Time  0.08s (in thread 0ms, allocated 0b)
```

### Migrating Tests from Jest to Vitest

Since Vitest is highly compatible with the Jest API, migrating existing tests is relatively straightforward. We'll migrate the tests from the previous section to Vitest.

1. Install the required dependencies:

```Shell
npm install supertest @types/supertest
```

1. Update the `test/index.test.ts` file with the existing tests:

```TypeScript
import { describe, expect, test, it } from 'vitest';
import request from "supertest";
import { app } from "../index";

describe("POST /sum", () => {
    it("should return the sum of two numbers", async () => {
        const res = await request(app).post("/sum").send({
            a: 1,
            b: 2
        });
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
        expect(res.body.answer).toBe(3);
    });

    it("should return 411 if no inputs are provided", async () => {
        const res = await request(app).post("/sum").send({});
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(411);
        expect(res.body.message).toBe("Incorrect inputs");
    });
});

describe("GET /sum", () => {
    it("should return the sum of two numbers", async () => {
        const res = await request(app)
            .get("/sum")
            .set({
                a: "1",
                b: "2"
            })
            .send();
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
        expect(res.body.answer).toBe(3);
    });

    it("should return 411 if no inputs are provided", async () => {
        const res = await request(app)
            .get("/sum").send();
        expect(res.statusCode).toBe(411);
    });
});
```

Notice that the only change required was updating the imports from `@jest/globals` to `vitest`. The rest of the test code remains the same, showcasing the compatibility between Jest and Vitest.

1. Run the test script:

```Shell
npm run test
```

You should see output similar to the following:

![Untitled 2 31.png](../../../../Images/Untitled%202%2031.png)

This example demonstrates how to set up a simple Express project, configure Vitest as the testing framework, and migrate existing tests from Jest to Vitest with minimal changes.

  

  

# Adding a Database

When working with external services or databases in your backend application, there are two common approaches to testing:

1. **Mocking out the external service calls (unit tests)**: In this approach, you mock or stub the external service or database calls, allowing you to test your application's logic without relying on the actual external dependencies.
2. **Starting the external services when the tests are running and stopping them after the tests end (integration/end-to-end tests)**: This approach involves setting up and running the actual external services or databases during the test execution, allowing you to test the integration between your application and these external dependencies.

In this section, we'll explore the first approach by mocking out the database calls using Prisma.

### Setting up Prisma

1. Install Prisma:

```Shell
npm install prisma
```

1. Initialize Prisma:

```Shell
npx prisma init
```

This command creates a `prisma` directory and a `schema.prisma` file.

1. Add a basic schema in `schema.prisma`:

```Plain
model Sum {
  id          Int @id   @default(autoincrement())
  a           Int
  b           Int
  result      Int
}
```

1. Generate the Prisma client (we don't need to migrate since we won't be using an actual database):

```Shell
npx prisma generate
```

1. Create a `src/db.ts` file to export the Prisma client:

```TypeScript
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
export const prismaClient = new PrismaClient();

### Updating the Express Server

Update the `src/index.ts` file to store the requests in the database using Prisma:

```TypeScript
import express from "express";
import { z } from "zod";
import { prismaClient } from "./db";

export const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const sumInput = z.object({
    a: z.number(),
    b: z.number()
});

app.post("/sum", async (req, res) => {
    const parsedResponse = sumInput.safeParse(req.body);

    if (!parsedResponse.success) {
        return res.status(411).json({
            message: "Incorrect inputs"
        });
    }

    const answer = parsedResponse.data.a + parsedResponse.data.b;

    await prismaClient.sum.create({
        data: {
            a: parsedResponse.data.a,
            b: parsedResponse.data.b,
            result: answer
        }
    });

    res.json({
        answer
    });
});

app.get("/sum", (req, res) => {
    const parsedResponse = sumInput.safeParse({
        a: Number(req.headers["a"]),
        b: Number(req.headers["b"])
    });

    if (!parsedResponse.success) {
        return res.status(411).json({
            message: "Incorrect inputs"
        });
    }

    const answer = parsedResponse.data.a + parsedResponse.data.b;

    res.json({
        answer
    });
});
```

In this updated code, we import the `prismaClient` from `./db.ts` and use it to create a new record in the `Sum` table whenever a POST request is made to the `/sum` endpoint.

# Mocking Dependencies

When writing unit tests, it's a common practice to mock out external service calls or dependencies. This approach allows you to test the core logic of your application without relying on external services or databases, ensuring that your tests run quickly and consistently.

### Mocking

Mocking, as the name suggests, means creating a fake or simulated version of a file, class, or variable during the test execution. This is particularly useful when dealing with external dependencies or services that are not directly related to the code being tested.

### Creating a Mock

Vitest provides a utility function called `vi.mock` to create mocks. Here's an example of how to create a mock:

```TypeScript
vi.mock('./myModule', () => ({
  myFunction: vi.fn(() => 'mocked value'),
}));
```

In this example, we're mocking the `myModule` file and providing a mock implementation for the `myFunction` function within that module. The `vi.fn` function creates a mock function that can be configured to return a specific value or perform custom logic.

### Mocking the `prismaClient`

To mock out the `prismaClient` instance from the `db.ts` file, you can add the following code to the top of `index.test.ts`:

```TypeScript
vi.mock('../db', () => ({
  prismaClient: { sum: { create: vi.fn() }}
}));
```

In this example, we're mocking the `db.ts` file and providing a mock implementation for the `prismaClient` object. Specifically, we're mocking the `create` function within the `sum` object, which is the function we're calling in our application.

Since we know we're only calling `prismaClient.sum.create`, we've mocked the implementation of that function. A mock function created with `vi.fn()` does nothing and returns `undefined` when the function call succeeds.

After adding this mock, running `npm run test` should succeed.

### Problems

While the provided mocking approach works, there are two potential problems:

1. **Handling Return Values**: Currently, the mocked `prismaClient.sum.create` function returns `undefined`. However, in a real database call, the function would return some actual data. If you need to test the logic that depends on the return value of the database call, you'll need to configure the mock function to return the expected data.
2. **Maintaining the Mock**: As your application grows and you start using more functions or tables from the Prisma client, you'll need to update the mock implementation accordingly. For example, if you start using the `findOne` function or add a new table called `users`, you'll need to update the mock to include these new functions or tables.

To address these problems, you can consider using a more robust mocking library or approach that allows you to create dynamic mocks or automatically generate mocks based on the actual implementation of the `prismaClient`. One such library is `vitest-mock-extended`, which provides additional utilities for creating and managing mocks in Vitest.

  

  

# Deep Mocking

In the previous section, we mocked the `prismaClient` instance by manually specifying the functions we wanted to mock. However, as your application grows and you start using more functions or tables from the Prisma client, maintaining the mock implementation can become cumbersome.

Deep mocking is a technique that allows you to automatically mock all the properties and functions of an object, without having to specify them individually. This approach can simplify the mocking process and make it easier to maintain your tests as your application evolves.

### Using `vitest-mock-extended` for Deep Mocking

The `vitest-mock-extended` library provides utilities for creating deep mocks in Vitest. Here's how you can use it to mock the `prismaClient` instance:

1. Install the `vitest-mock-extended` library:

```Shell
npm install -D vitest-mock-extended
```

1. Create a `__mocks__/db.ts` file:

```TypeScript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { mockDeep, mockReset } from 'vitest-mock-extended'

export const prismaClient = mockDeep<PrismaClient>()
```

In this file, we're using the `mockDeep` function from `vitest-mock-extended` to create a deep mock of the `PrismaClient` instance. This will automatically mock all the properties and functions of the `prismaClient` object.

1. In your `index.test.ts` file, remove the previous mock implementation and replace it with a simple `vi.mock('../db')`:

```TypeScript
vi.mock('../db');
```

By using `vi.mock('../db')`, Vitest will automatically use the mocked version of the `db.ts` file from the `__mocks__` directory.

1. Run the tests:

```Shell
npm run test
```

The tests should now pass, as the `prismaClient` instance is being mocked using the deep mock created with `vitest-mock-extended`.

### Handling Return Values

In the previous example, the mocked `prismaClient` functions return `undefined` by default. However, if you need to test the logic that depends on the return value of a database call, you'll need to configure the mock function to return the expected data.

Here's an updated version of the `src/index.ts` file that returns the `id` of the created record in the response:

```TypeScript
import express from "express";
import { z } from "zod";
import { prismaClient } from "./db";

export const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const sumInput = z.object({
    a: z.number(),
    b: z.number()
});

app.post("/sum", async (req, res) => {
    const parsedResponse = sumInput.safeParse(req.body);

    if (!parsedResponse.success) {
        return res.status(411).json({
            message: "Incorrect inputs"
        });
    }

    const answer = parsedResponse.data.a + parsedResponse.data.b;

    const response = await prismaClient.sum.create({
        data: {
            a: parsedResponse.data.a,
            b: parsedResponse.data.b,
            result: answer
        }
    });

    res.json({
        answer,
        id: response.id
    });
});

app.get("/sum", async (req, res) => {
    const parsedResponse = sumInput.safeParse({
        a: Number(req.headers["a"]),
        b: Number(req.headers["b"])
    });

    if (!parsedResponse.success) {
        return res.status(411).json({
            message: "Incorrect inputs"
        });
    }

    const answer = parsedResponse.data.a + parsedResponse.data.b;

    const response = await prismaClient.sum.create({
        data: {
            a: parsedResponse.data.a,
            b: parsedResponse.data.b,
            result: answer
        }
    });

    res.json({
        answer,
        id: response.id
    });
});
```

To handle the return value from the `prismaClient.sum.create` function, you can configure the mock in your `__mocks__/db.ts` file:

```TypeScript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { mockDeep, mockReset } from 'vitest-mock-extended'

const mockedPrismaClient = mockDeep<PrismaClient>()

beforeEach(() => {
  mockReset(mockedPrismaClient)
  mockedPrismaClient.sum.create.mockImplementation(({ data }) => ({
    id: 1, // or any other value you want to return
    ...data,
  }))
})

export const prismaClient = mockedPrismaClient
```

In this updated code, we're using the `mockImplementation` function to provide a custom implementation for the `prismaClient.sum.create` function. In this case, we're returning an object with an `id` property set to `1` and spreading the `data` object passed to the `create` function.

With this configuration, your tests should now pass, and you can assert the `id` property in the response.

> Deep mocking with `vitest-mock-extended` simplifies the mocking process and makes it easier to maintain your tests as your application grows. By automatically mocking all the properties and functions of an object, you can focus on configuring the mock behavior for the specific functions you need, without having to manually specify each function to be mocked.

  

  

# Mocking Return Values

In the previous section, we learned how to create deep mocks using `vitest-mock-extended`. However, in some cases, you may need to mock the return values of specific functions to test the logic that depends on those values.

Vitest provides several utilities for mocking return values, including `mockResolvedValue`, `mockRejectedValue`, and `mockImplementation`. In this section, we'll focus on using `mockResolvedValue` to mock the return value of the `prismaClient.sum.create` function.

### Using `mockResolvedValue`

1. Update the `index.test.ts` file to import the mocked `prismaClient` from the `__mocks__/db` file:

```TypeScript
import { prismaClient } from '../__mocks__/db';
```

1. In the test cases where you need to mock the return value of `prismaClient.sum.create`, use `mockResolvedValue` to provide the expected return value:

```TypeScript
prismaClient.sum.create.mockResolvedValue({
  id: 1,
  a: 1,
  b: 1,
  result: 3
});
```

This line mocks the `prismaClient.sum.create` function to resolve with the provided object, which represents the expected return value from the database.

1. Here's the updated `index.test.ts` file with the mocked return values:

```TypeScript
import { describe, expect, test, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import request from "supertest";
import { app } from "../index";
import { prismaClient } from '../__mocks__/db';

vi.mock('../db');

describe("POST /sum", () => {
  it("should return the sum of two numbers", async () => {
    prismaClient.sum.create.mockResolvedValue({
      id: 1,
      a: 1,
      b: 1,
      result: 3
    });

    const res = await request(app).post("/sum").send({
      a: 1,
      b: 2
    });
    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(res.body.answer).toBe(3);
  });

  it("should return 411 if no inputs are provided", async () => {
    const res = await request(app).post("/sum").send({});
    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(411);
    expect(res.body.message).toBe("Incorrect inputs");
  });
});

describe("GET /sum", () => {
  it("should return the sum of two numbers", async () => {
    prismaClient.sum.create.mockResolvedValue({
      id: 1,
      a: 1,
      b: 1,
      result: 3
    });

    const res = await request(app)
      .get("/sum")
      .set({
        a: "1",
        b: "2"
      })
      .send();
    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(res.body.answer).toBe(3);
  });

  it("should return 411 if no inputs are provided", async () => {
    const res = await request(app)
      .get("/sum").send();
    expect(res.statusCode).toBe(411);
  });
});
```

In this updated code, we're mocking the `prismaClient.sum.create` function to resolve with an object containing the expected `id`, `a`, `b`, and `result` properties. This allows us to test the logic that depends on the return value of the database call.

Note that we only need to mock the return value in the test cases where the control flow reaches the point where the `id` is needed. In the test cases where no inputs are provided, the control flow never reaches the point where the `id` is used, so we don't need to mock the return value in those cases.

> By using `mockResolvedValue`, you can easily mock the return values of specific functions and test the logic that depends on those values. This approach helps you write more comprehensive tests and ensure that your application behaves correctly under different scenarios.
