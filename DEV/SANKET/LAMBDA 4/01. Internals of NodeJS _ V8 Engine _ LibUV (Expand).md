A **runtime environment** is the setting in which a program is executed. Think of it as the "world" your program lives in once it‚Äôs running.

It provides:

1. **Infrastructure for Execution**
    
    - The CPU, memory, operating system, and any libraries or frameworks needed to run the program.
        
2. **Supportive Tools & Services**
    
    - Garbage collection (automatic memory management).
        
    - Exception handling (how errors are caught and handled).
        
    - Thread management (if the program uses concurrency).
        
    - Input/output operations (e.g., reading files, printing to screen).
        
3. **Runtime Libraries**
    
    - Prebuilt functions your code can call (like math operations, string handling, database connectors, network communication).

### Examples

- **Node.js Runtime Environment**  
    Lets you run JavaScript outside the browser, providing things like `fs` (file system access) and `http` modules.
    
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**  
    Runs compiled Java bytecode on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), with standard Java libraries.
    
- **Python Interpreter**  
    Provides the Python runtime with built-in libraries, memory handling, and exception support.
    

---

üëâ In short:  
A **runtime environment** is the layer that makes sure your code doesn‚Äôt just exist but actually _runs_, by giving it the necessary resources and rules of execution.


JS AS A PROGRAMMING LANAGUAGE HAS A COUPLE OF LIMITATIONS!!

JavaScript doesn't know how to access timers
![572x310](../../Images/image-763.png)

### 1. **ECMAScript vs JavaScript**

- **ECMAScript (ES)** is the _language specification_ (standardized by ECMA-262).
    
    - It defines core syntax and features: variables, loops, objects, arrays, promises, etc.
        
    - Think of it as: ‚ÄúThe grammar + rules of the language.‚Äù
        
- **JavaScript** is the _implementation_ of ECMAScript in different environments.
    
    - Browsers and Node.js both implement ECMAScript, but they also add **extra APIs** on top to interact with the outside world.

###  **ECMAScript is a specification, not an implementation**

- **ECMAScript (ES)** is **not the language itself you run** ‚Äî it‚Äôs the _blueprint / specification_.
    
    - It describes what the language should look like (syntax, semantics, built-in objects).
        
    - Example: `let`, `class`, `Promise`, `Array.prototype.map` are all defined in the ES spec.
        
- **JavaScript** is the **real-world implementation** of ECMAScript (in Chrome, Firefox, Node.js, etc.).
    
    - When we casually say ‚ÄúECMAScript is a language,‚Äù it‚Äôs shorthand. Strictly speaking:
        
        - **Spec = ECMAScript**
            
        - **Implementation = JavaScript runtime (browser, Node.js, etc.)**

- The ECMAScript spec only covers **language-level constructs**.
    
- Things that depend on the environment (timers, DOM, networking, filesystem) are **deliberately excluded** because the spec doesn‚Äôt assume whether JS will run in a browser, on a server, on an IoT device, etc.
- **ECMAScript spec**:
    
    - Core objects: `Object`, `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `Promise`.
        
    - Syntax: `if`, `while`, `async/await`.
        
- **Browser runtime adds**:
    
    - `setTimeout`, `fetch`, `document.getElementById` (because browser knows about HTML, network).
        
- **Node.js runtime adds**:
    
    - `setTimeout`, `fs`, `http`, `process` (because Node knows about files and OS).

- **ECMAScript = Grammar book** ‚Üí defines _how sentences are formed_.
    
- **JavaScript runtime = Country using the grammar** ‚Üí each country may add its own slang/phrases

- The term **JavaScript** is used broadly to mean _ECMAScript + runtime features_.
    
- That‚Äôs why people often blur the line and say ‚ÄúECMAScript is JavaScript.‚Äù
    
- But strictly:
    
    - **ECMAScript** = the standard (what‚Äôs common everywhere).
        
    - **JavaScript** = the real thing you write/run (which includes environment extras).
- **They‚Äôre different** (spec vs implementation).
    
- But **JavaScript conforms to ECMAScript** and then extends it.

### 2. **Why `setTimeout`, `fetch`, `getElementById` are not in ECMAScript**

- ECMAScript doesn‚Äôt know about **HTML**, **network requests**, or **files**. It‚Äôs just the _language_.
    
- Functions like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, or `document.getElementById` are **not part of ECMAScript**, but provided by the **runtime environment** where JS runs.


### 3. **Different Runtimes, Different APIs**

- **Browser Runtime** adds:
    
    - `setTimeout`, `setInterval` ‚Üí scheduling timers.
        
    - `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest` ‚Üí networking APIs.
        
    - `document.getElementById`, `querySelector` ‚Üí DOM APIs (because browser has access to HTML).
        
    - `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` ‚Üí storage APIs.
    
- **Node.js Runtime** adds:
    
    - `setTimeout`, `setInterval` ‚Üí (similar timers).
        
    - `fs` module ‚Üí file system access (because Node can interact with your OS).
        
    - `http` module ‚Üí networking server/client.
        
    - `process` ‚Üí info about the running process.


**Node.js** is a **runtime environment** that lets you run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

Normally, JavaScript was created to run only inside browsers (like Chrome, Firefox) to make web pages interactive. But Node.js extends JavaScript‚Äôs use to the **server side** (backend).


### 1. The Context (Before 2009)

- **JavaScript** was stuck in browsers.
    
- Its main job: manipulate the DOM, respond to clicks, send AJAX requests.
    
- Browsers sandbox JavaScript for **security reasons**:
    
    - No direct file system access.
        
    - No access to OS processes.
        
    - No way to open raw network sockets.
        

So you couldn‚Äôt use JavaScript to build serious backend/server software.

---

### 2. Ryan Dahl‚Äôs Idea (2009)

Ryan thought:  
üëâ _‚ÄúWhat if JavaScript could run outside the browser?‚Äù_

- Use **Google‚Äôs V8 engine** (already very fast, thanks to Chrome).
    
- Build a **runtime environment** that gives JavaScript:
    
    - File system access (`fs`).
        
    - Process & memory access (`process`).
        
    - Networking (create servers, sockets, handle HTTP).


This runtime became **Node.js**.

---

### 3. Why it was Revolutionary

- Suddenly, JavaScript wasn‚Äôt just for **frontend** ‚Äî it could now do **backend** too.
    
- This enabled:
    
    - Reading/writing files on disk.
        
    - Running OS-level tasks.
        
    - Accepting TCP/HTTP connections ‚Üí building servers.
        
    - Communicating with other machines over the network.


![image-765.png](../../Images/image-765.png)



### 1. **What is a Framework?**

- A **framework** is a set of **pre-written code, structure, and conventions** to help you build applications faster.
    
- It dictates **how you should write your code** (inversion of control).
    
- Examples:
    
    - **Express.js** (web framework for Node.js).
        
    - **Django** (Python framework).
        
    - **Spring Boot** (Java framework).


üëâ Framework = "predefined skeleton" ‚Üí you plug your code into it.

---

### 2. **What is Node.js then?**

- **Node.js is NOT a framework.**
    
- It‚Äôs a **runtime environment**.
    
- It provides:
    
    - A **JavaScript engine (V8)** to run JS code outside the browser.
        
    - APIs for OS-level operations (file system, processes, networking).
        
    - An event loop & async I/O model.
        

But:

- It doesn‚Äôt force structure.
    
- It doesn‚Äôt tell you _how_ to build your app.
    
- It‚Äôs just the **platform** where you run your code.

![image-766.png](../../Images/image-766.png)

In programming, scaffolding refers to¬†==the automated generation of basic code structures, often used to kickstart application development==.

###  Node.js and the DOM

- **Node.js does NOT have a DOM.**
    
    - Node.js runs outside the browser ‚Üí there‚Äôs no HTML page to render.
        
    - That means no `document`, no `window`, no `getElementById`.
        

So you cannot do direct DOM manipulation with Node.js.
![image-767.png](../../Images/image-767.png)



## What does ‚Äúcross-platform‚Äù mean in general?

- **Cross-platform** = ‚Äúworks on multiple operating systems without changing code.‚Äù
    
- Platforms = Windows ü™ü, macOS üçè, Linux üêß.
    
- If something is **cross-platform**, you can:
    
    - Write a program once.
        
    - Run it on different OSes with little/no modification.

![image-768.png](../../Images/image-768.png)

Before Node.js, if you wrote server software in **C/C++**, you often had to rewrite parts of it for different operating systems.  
Node.js removed that pain:

- Same JS code.
    
- Run anywhere (Windows, Linux, macOS).
    
- That‚Äôs why people call it a **cross-platform runtime**.

Node.js is a cross-platform runtime because it lets JavaScript code run outside the browser on any operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) without needing to rewrite code, thanks to the V8 engine + libuv library handling OS differences under the hood.

![image-769.png](../../Images/image-769.png)

![image-770.png](../../Images/image-770.png)

## **JavaScript Layer**

This is what _you_ interact with as a developer.

- It‚Äôs the **high-level APIs** written in JavaScript, exposed for you to use.
    
- Examples:
    
    - `setTimeout`
        
    - `fs.readFile`
        
    - `http.createServer`
        

But those functions you call in JS don‚Äôt _actually_ perform the task directly.  
Instead, they:

- Call into Node‚Äôs **C++ bindings layer**, which then interacts with the OS.

## **C++ Layer**

This is Node.js‚Äô internal core, written in C/C++.

- Provides low-level implementations of things like file I/O, networking, timers.
    
- Uses **libuv** to talk to the operating system in a cross-platform way.
    
- Bridges the gap between **JavaScript (V8)** and **system calls (Windows/Linux/macOS)**.
    

For example:

- When you call `setTimeout` in JS ‚Üí it‚Äôs defined in JS layer.
    
- That call is passed down to the **C++ layer** ‚Üí which uses libuv to register the timer with the OS event loop.
    
- When the timer expires, libuv pushes the callback back into V8 to run your JS function.


![image-771.png](../../Images/image-771.png)

- Originally, JS only lived in **browsers** (sandboxed, no direct access to files, CPU, or network sockets beyond HTTP).

üëâ That‚Äôs why JS by itself **cannot**:

- Open files on your disk.
    
- Talk directly to the network with sockets.
    
- Create threads.
    
- Call operating system functions like `read()` or `open()`.


It‚Äôs **too high-level and too restricted**.


## 2. Enter V8 (JS Engine)

- V8 is Google‚Äôs **JavaScript engine** (written in C++).
    
- Its job: take JS code and run it fast (compiles JS ‚Üí machine code).
    
- But V8 only gives you **pure JS runtime**: numbers, strings, objects, promises.
    
- V8 has **no file system, no HTTP, no setTimeout** ‚Äî those are added by _runtimes_ like browsers or Node.js.
    

üëâ V8 = **executes your JS** but doesn‚Äôt give you OS powers.


## 4. Why Node.js Needs **Three Languages**

Node.js is a **hybrid system**:

1. **JavaScript (lib/ folder in repo)**
    
    - Friendly APIs developers use (`fs.readFile`, `http.createServer`, `setTimeout`).
        
    - Written in plain JS.
        
    - But these JS functions don‚Äôt ‚Äúdo‚Äù the work themselves ‚Äî they **delegate down**.
        
2. **C++ (src/ folder in repo)**
    
    - The ‚Äúglue‚Äù between JS (via V8) and the OS.
        
    - Defines **bindings** (native functions JS can call).
        
    - Example: JS `fs.readFile` ‚Üí calls into a C++ function ‚Üí which invokes libuv.
        
3. **C (deps/libuv, OpenSSL, zlib, etc.)**
    
    - Handles raw system-level tasks.
        
    - libuv (C library) = event loop + async I/O.
        
    - OpenSSL (C library) = HTTPS/crypto.
        
    - zlib (C library) = compression.
        

üëâ Think of it like:

- **JS** = steering wheel, dashboard (easy for you).
    
- **C++** = gearbox, pedals (bridge).
    
- **C** = engine and wheels (directly push the OS).
![image-772.png](../../Images/image-772.png)

![image-773.png](../../Images/image-773.png)

## Why Not ‚ÄúJust JS Everywhere‚Äù?

- **JS can‚Äôt make syscalls.** It can‚Äôt call Linux‚Äôs `read()`, or Windows‚Äô `CreateFile()`.
    
- Without C/C++, JS is stuck in a sandbox.
    
- Node.js uses **C++** because:
    
    - It integrates with V8 (which is also C++).
        
    - It‚Äôs good for building large systems (classes, RAII, etc.).
        
- Node.js uses **C** because:
    
    - Libraries like libuv, OpenSSL, zlib are in C (closer to OS).
        

üëâ So:

- If Node was **only JS** ‚Üí no filesystem, no network, no timers.
    
- If Node was **only C++** ‚Üí developers would hate it (too verbose).
    
- The combo gives us the best of both worlds.

![image-774.png](../../Images/image-774.png)


- Browser runtime and Node.js runtime communicate using the **Internet Protocols** (HTTP, WebSocket, etc).
    
- They don‚Äôt ‚Äúshare functions‚Äù or ‚Äúcall each other‚Äôs methods‚Äù.
    
- Instead:
    
    - **Browser = client** ‚Üí makes request.
        
    - **Node.js = server** ‚Üí listens and responds.
        

Think of it as:  
üîπ Browser runtime is like a **phone**.  
üîπ Node runtime is like the **telephone exchange**.  
The **HTTP protocol** is the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù they use to talk.


## 1. What even is a JS engine?

- A **JavaScript engine** is a **program** that takes your **JS code (text)** and turns it into something the computer can actually run (**machine code**).
    
- It‚Äôs like the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of JavaScript.
    
- Examples:
    
    - **V8** (Chrome, Node.js)
        
    - **SpiderMonkey** (Firefox)
        
    - **JavaScriptCore** (Safari)
        

---

## 2. Why do we need it?

Computers don‚Äôt understand `let x = 10;`.  
They only understand **binary machine instructions** (like `10101010`).  
So we need a translator ‚Üí **JS Engine**.


![image-775.png](../../Images/image-775.png)

### (b) **Interpretation / Compilation**

- Old engines only **interpreted** JS (ran line by line ‚Üí slow).
    
- Modern engines (like V8) use **JIT compilation**:
    
    1. Interpreter (Ignition in V8) ‚Üí runs code quickly first.
        
    2. Profiler watches code that runs often (‚Äúhot code‚Äù).
        
    3. Compiler (TurboFan in V8) ‚Üí optimizes hot code into **fast machine code**.
        

So your JS runs almost as fast as C++.

---

### (c) **Execution**

- The generated machine code executes on CPU.
    
- If optimization assumptions fail, V8 can **deoptimize** and go back to slower code.
    

---

### (d) **Memory Management**

- The engine also handles memory:
    
    - Allocates memory for variables, objects, arrays.
        
    - Uses **Garbage Collector (GC)** to clean unused memory automatically.

![image-776.png](../../Images/image-776.png)


**A JavaScript engine takes raw JS code, parses it, compiles it into machine code, runs it on CPU, manages memory, but does not give external APIs (those come from the runtime).**

## 1. Node.js stack (zoomed in)

- **Your JS code** ‚Üí runs inside **V8 engine**.
    
- V8 doesn‚Äôt know about files, timers, sockets.
    
- Node.js provides **bindings** (C++ + libuv) that let JS talk to the OS.
    
- **libuv** is like a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù ‚Üí it wraps OS features into a uniform API.
    

---

## 2. Example 1 ‚Üí `console.log("hi")`

- Your JS calls `console.log`.
    
- Node maps that to **C++ code** that writes to `stdout`.
    
- `stdout` is just a **stream handled by the OS** (usually your terminal).
    
- OS sends the text to your terminal screen (maybe via a driver).
    

So yes ‚Üí the OS prints it.

---

## 3. Example 2 ‚Üí `setTimeout(() => {}, 1000)`

- You ask Node to run a callback after 1s.
    
- Node hands this request to **libuv**.
    
- libuv sets a **timer handle** using OS functionality (if available) or its own event loop logic.
    
- The OS keeps track of time (using its **system clock / kernel timers**).
    
- After ~1000 ms, OS notifies libuv ‚Üí libuv pushes callback into Node‚Äôs event loop ‚Üí your JS callback finally runs.
    

So yes ‚Üí the **OS clock** is what makes timers reliable.

---

## 4. Example 3 ‚Üí Networking (`http.createServer(...)`)

- Node asks OS: ‚ÄúHey, listen on port 3000.‚Äù
    
- OS opens a **socket** (network endpoint).
    
- OS handles packets (TCP, UDP) at a low level.
    
- When a new request comes in, OS wakes Node/libuv, and your callback runs in JS.
    

So again ‚Üí **OS does the heavy lifting**.

---

## 5. Key insight üß†

‚úÖ Node.js (and browser) ‚Üí **abstractions**.  
‚úÖ libuv + C++ ‚Üí **bridge**.  
‚úÖ OS ‚Üí **real worker** (timers, IO, networking, processes, stdout, etc).  
‚úÖ CPU ‚Üí executes the final machine instructions.

---

üëâ So your feeling is correct:  
**Everything in the end is done by the OS (or hardware, like CPU/clock). Node (and libuv) just give you a nice JS-friendly way to access it.**


![image-777.png](../../Images/image-777.png)

## Why do we have **many engines**?

Because **different companies, browsers, and projects** wanted their _own implementation_ of JavaScript. Reasons:

### (a) Browser competition üèÅ

- Each browser wanted to optimize JS performance for _its own needs_.
    
- JavaScript was getting heavy (Google Docs, Gmail, React apps, etc.), so speed was a big deal.
    
- So:
    
    - **Google** built **V8** (used in Chrome, Node.js).
        
    - **Mozilla** built **SpiderMonkey** (first ever JS engine, still in Firefox).
        
    - **Apple** built **JavaScriptCore** (aka Nitro, in Safari).
        
    - **Microsoft** built **Chakra** (used in Edge Legacy).
        

---

### (b) Different trade-offs ‚öñÔ∏è

Each engine makes choices:

- **Speed vs Memory** (V8 goes for aggressive JIT optimization).
    
- **Security** (JavaScriptCore is deeply tied to Safari‚Äôs sandbox).
    
- **Portability** (SpiderMonkey is very hackable and used in many research projects).
    
- **Compatibility** with OS or tools.


![586x349](../../Images/image-778.png)
This is ast tree!!
# üß© Components of V8 Engine

## 1. **Parser**

üëâ **Job:** Read raw JavaScript text and convert it into a structured format (AST).

- The computer doesn‚Äôt understand `"let x = 10;"`. It only sees it as text.
    
- Parser breaks it into **tokens** (like `let`, `x`, `=`, `10`, `;`).
    
- Then it builds a **tree** structure called the **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.

![image-779.png](../../Images/image-779.png)


![image-780.png](../../Images/image-780.png)





![image-781.png](../../Images/image-781.png)





![image-782.png](../../Images/image-782.png)



# üîÑ How They Work Together

1. Parser ‚Üí builds AST from your JS text.
    
2. Ignition ‚Üí AST ‚Üí Bytecode ‚Üí starts execution.
    
3. Turbofan ‚Üí turns hot bytecode into optimized machine code.
    
4. Garbage Collector ‚Üí cleans up memory during/after execution.
    

---

If you imagine V8 as a **kitchen**:

- Parser = reading the recipe.
    
- Ignition = start cooking quickly, even if messy.
    
- Turbofan = improve cooking with better tools once you know the recipe is used a lot.
    
- GC = cleaning up used dishes so the kitchen doesn‚Äôt overflow.

![709x350](../../Images/image-783.png)


# üß† What is Compilation?

Compilation = turning **human-readable code** (JS, C, etc.) ‚Üí **machine code** (CPU instructions).  
Two big styles:

---

## 1. **Ahead-of-Time Compilation (AOT)**

üëâ Compile everything **before** the program runs.

- Example: C, C++
    
    - You run `gcc file.c ‚Üí file.exe`.
        
    - Now `file.exe` is pure machine code.
        
    - CPU runs it directly ‚Äî **super fast startup**.
        

‚ö° Pros:

- Very fast execution (already machine code).
    
- No runtime compilation overhead.
    

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:

- Can‚Äôt optimize based on _actual runtime behavior_.
    
- Big binaries (compiled upfront).
    

---

## 2. **Just-in-Time Compilation (JIT)**

üëâ Compile **while the program is running**.

- Example: Java, JavaScript (V8).
    
- Steps:
    
    1. Start fast using interpreter (bytecode).
        
    2. While running, JIT notices ‚Äúthis function is hot üî•‚Äù.
        
    3. Compiler converts that function ‚Üí optimized machine code **on the fly**.
        

‚ö° Pros:

- Optimizes based on **real program usage** (e.g., types of variables).
    
- Good balance: start fast, run fast later.
    

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:

- Slower startup (compilation happens at runtime).
    
- More complex runtime (interpreter + compiler + GC).
    

---

# üîé Where V8 Fits

- **Parser** ‚Üí AST.
    
- **Ignition (Interpreter)** ‚Üí Bytecode (fast startup).
    
- **Turbofan (Compiler)** ‚Üí JIT optimization.
    

So V8 uses a **hybrid model**:

- Start with Ignition (fast, but slower long-term).
    
- Promote hot code ‚Üí Turbofan (JIT, fast long-term).
    

---

# üîÑ AOT vs JIT in Practice

|Feature|AOT (C/C++)|JIT (V8 JS)|
|---|---|---|
|Compilation time|Before running|While running|
|Startup speed|üöÄ Fast|üê¢ Slower (bytecode first)|
|Runtime optimization|‚ùå None|‚úÖ Yes, based on usage|
|File size|Big binary upfront|Smaller (source + engine)|

---

# üç© Analogy

- **AOT**: You bake the entire cake in the morning ‚Üí ready to eat instantly when someone asks.
    
- **JIT**: You start with a half-prepared dough, then finish baking only the slices people actually order ‚Üí flexible but adds delay when cooking.
    

---

üëâ Bonus: Some languages (like **Java with GraalVM**, or **.NET Native**) combine both:

- **Tiered compilation** = start JIT, but also allow optional AOT for known code.


![image-784.png](../../Images/image-784.png)


![image-785.png](../../Images/image-785.png)


## 1. **Program vs Process**

- A **program** is just a passive piece of code stored on disk (e.g., `a.exe`, `python script.py`).
    
    - It contains instructions written by a programmer.
        
    - But it is not _doing anything_ yet ‚Äî it‚Äôs just static data on storage (hard disk/SSD).
        
- A **process** is a **program in execution**.
    
    - When you run a program, the OS loads it from disk into **RAM**.
        
    - It assigns resources (memory, CPU time, etc.).
        
    - It becomes _active_ and starts executing instructions.
        
    - Example: Double-clicking `chrome.exe` creates a **Chrome process**.
        

üëâ So:  
**Program = passive (on disk)**  
**Process = active (in RAM, running under OS)**

## 2. **What happens when a program becomes a process**

When the OS runs a program:

1. It loads the program into **RAM**.
    
2. It creates a **Process Control Block (PCB)** ‚Äî a data structure that stores info about this process.
    
3. It allocates memory regions (explained below).
    
4. It sets up execution (starting point: the main function).

## 3. **Memory structure of a process**

A process in memory is divided into parts:

- **Text (Code segment)** ‚Üí contains the actual machine instructions.
    
- **Heap memory** ‚Üí dynamically allocated memory (`malloc`, `new` in C++/Java).
    
- **Call stack** ‚Üí used for function calls, local variables, return addresses.
    
- **Data segment** ‚Üí global variables, static variables.
    

So when you write a program, once running, it has:

- **Code (text)**
    
- **Heap**
    
- **Stack**
    
- **Data**

## 4. **Process Control Block (PCB)**

The PCB is like an **ID card** of a process that the OS uses to manage it.  
It stores:

- **PID (Process ID):** Unique identifier for each process.
    
- **Program Counter (PC):** Address of the next instruction to execute.
    
- **Process State:** Running, Ready, Waiting, etc.
    
- **CPU Registers:** Current values of registers (so it can resume later).
    
- **Memory info:** Which memory areas (heap, stack, text) belong to the process.
    
- **Scheduling info:** Priority, etc.
    

üëâ When a process is stopped and later resumed, the PCB makes sure it continues from **exactly where it left off**.
