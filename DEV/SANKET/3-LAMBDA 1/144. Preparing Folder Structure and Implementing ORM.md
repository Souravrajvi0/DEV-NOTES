**Sequelize** is one of the most popular **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** libraries for **Node.js**, designed for working with **SQL-based databases** like:

- PostgreSQL
    
- MySQL / MariaDB
    
- SQLite
    
- Microsoft SQL Server

Just installing sequelize won't help!! We'll need a driver as well!
## Sequelize Is an ORM, Not a Driver

- **Sequelize** is a **high-level ORM** that lets you write database queries in **JavaScript**, using model definitions, validations, and relationships.
    
- But **it does not handle low-level communication** with the actual database engine (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc).
    

That’s where **drivers** come in.

## 🔌 What Is a Database Driver?

A **driver** is a **low-level library** that knows **how to connect to the database**, send queries, and retrieve results. Sequelize depends on these drivers to talk to the database.

Here’s how it works conceptually:


`npm install --save mysql2`
```scss
Your Code (Node.js)    
↓
Sequelize (ORM abstraction)   
↓ 
Database Driver (e.g., mysql2, pg)      
↓ 
Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
```

---

## 🧰 Examples of Sequelize + Driver Combinations

|Database|Required Driver Package|
|---|---|
|MySQL|`mysql2`|
|PostgreSQL|`pg` and `pg-hstore`|
|SQLite|`sqlite3`|
|MSSQL|`tedious`|





## ✅ Why It’s Not Bundled by Default

Sequelize doesn’t bundle all drivers because:

1. Different apps use different databases — no need to install all.
    
2. Each driver has its own dependencies and size.
    
3. You explicitly choose what to connect to.



## 🔄 Summary

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|**Why do I need a driver after installing Sequelize?**|Because Sequelize is an **abstraction**, and the driver does the **actual database communication**.|
|**Can Sequelize work without a driver?**|❌ No — it needs a driver to connect and execute SQL behind the scenes.|
|**What happens if I forget to install the driver?**|Sequelize will throw a connection error or crash on startup.|

## 🧰 What is Sequelize CLI?

**Sequelize CLI** is a command-line tool that helps manage your Sequelize-based project. It automates tasks like:

- Creating models
    
- Generating migrations
    
- Running migrations
    
- Seeding data
    
- Managing configurations

## 🔥 Why Use Sequelize CLI?

|Purpose|Without CLI|With CLI|
|---|---|---|
|**Create models**|Write full model manually|`sequelize model:generate --name User`|
|**Create migrations**|Write raw SQL or JS manually|CLI auto-generates template|
|**Run migrations**|Manually apply SQL|`sequelize db:migrate` applies in order|
|**Seed data**|Write scripts by hand|`sequelize db:seed:all` populates tables|
|**Project setup**|Create folders/config manually|`sequelize init` creates structure|

We do `sequelize init` in the `/src` folder (instead of the root) to keep our application logic organized, clean, and scalable.
ye folder ban gaye!

## 🚀 Why Run It Inside `/src` Instead?

### ✅ A. Keeps All Application Code in One Place

Running `sequelize init` **inside `/src`** gives you:

`/src   /models   /migrations   /seeders   /config`

### ✅ B. Prepares for Production Build Tools

When using tools like:

- **TypeScript**
    
- **Webpack**
    
- **Babel**
    

You want your source code in `/src` and your build output in `/dist`. So it's smart to structure that way from the beginning.



### ✅ C. Better Scalability and Collaboration

In a bigger project, you may have:



`/src   /models   /controllers   /routes   /services   /middlewares   /migrations`

Keeping everything under `/src` makes the project:

- Easier to navigate
    
- More maintainable
    
- More professional
    



## 🔧 How to Customize Sequelize CLI for `/src`

You need to tell Sequelize CLI where your folders are. Create a **`.sequelizerc`** file in the root:



`const path = require('path');  module.exports = {   'config': path.resolve('src/config', 'config.js'),   'models-path': path.resolve('src/models'),   'seeders-path': path.resolve('src/seeders'),   'migrations-path': path.resolve('src/migrations'), };`
## ✅ Summary

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|**Why not run `sequelize init` in root?**|It clutters the root with app folders like `/models`, `/migrations`, etc.|
|**Why use `/src`?**|Organizes all source code, better for team projects, build systems, and readability.|
|**How to make CLI work with `/src`?**|Use a `.sequelizerc` file to redirect Sequelize paths.|

Ye Config.json bhi mili hai!

We can't just work on the production database with which the customers are interacting 
That's why we need a seperrate development database

Migrations files are used to do version control of your database!

## 📁 `/models`

> **Purpose:** Defines your database models (tables) and their relationships.

### Contains:

- One file per table (e.g., `user.js`, `post.js`)
    
- Sequelize’s `define()` function that maps a model to a table
    

### Example:

```javascript
// /models/user.js
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const User = sequelize.define("User", {
    username: DataTypes.STRING,
    email: DataTypes.STRING,
  });
  return User;
};


```


---

## 📁 `/migrations`

> **Purpose:** Tracks schema changes over time.

### Contains:

- Time-stamped migration files like `20240521111111-create-user.js`
    
- Each migration describes how to **create/update/drop** tables and fields
    

### Example:




```javascript
module.exports = {
  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.createTable('Users', {
      id: {
        primaryKey: true,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
        autoIncrement: true
      },
      username: Sequelize.STRING
    });
  },
  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.dropTable('Users');
  }
};

```

`npx sequelize db:migrate        # Apply migrations npx sequelize db:migrate:undo   # Undo the last migration`

---

## 📁 `/seeders`

> **Purpose:** Fill the database with dummy or default data.

### Contains:

- Files that insert data into tables using Sequelize methods
    

### Example:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.bulkInsert('Users', [
      { username: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
      { username: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' },
    ]);
  },
  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.bulkDelete('Users', null, {});
  }
};

```

### Use:


`npx sequelize db:seed:all       # Run all seeders npx sequelize db:seed:undo:all  # Undo all seeders`

---

## 📁 `/config/config.json`

> **Purpose:** Stores DB credentials for each environment (dev, test, prod).

This is used by Sequelize CLI to connect to the database. It specifies:

- username
    
- password
    
- database name
    
- host
    
- dialect (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
    

You can override or replace it with a `config.js` file to load `.env` variables for security.

## ✅ Summary Table

|Folder|Purpose|Example Use|
|---|---|---|
|`/models`|Define tables|`sequelize.define(...)`|
|`/migrations`|Track schema changes|`sequelize db:migrate`|
|`/seeders`|Add sample/default data|`sequelize db:seed:all`|
|`/config/config.json`|DB connection settings|Used by CLI tools|
