An `.env` file is typically used to store environment variables for applications, keeping sensitive or configurable information separate from the main codebase. Here's a breakdown of common contents you might put in an `.env` file, depending on the type of application you're working on:

### 1.**Database Configuration**

`DB_HOST=localhost`
`DB_PORT=5432`
`DB_USER=myuser`
`DB_PASSWORD=mypassword`
`DB_NAME=mydatabase`

### 2.**API Keys and Secrets**

These could be for third-party services like payment gateways, cloud storage, or analytics platforms:

`API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
`API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here`


### 3. **Server Configuration**

For specifying server-related variables, like port and environment:

PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

### 4. **JWT (JSON Web Token) Secret**

If you’re using JWTs for authentication, you’ll want to store your secret key here:
`JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here`

### 5. **Debugging and Logging**

For setting debugging or logging levels:
`DEBUG=true LOG_LEVEL=info`

### 6. **App-Specific Settings**

Anything else specific to your app:
`EMAIL_SERVER=smtp.mailtrap.io EMAIL_PORT=2525 EMAIL_USER=my_email_user EMAIL_PASSWORD=my_email_password`

### Example `.env` File
Here's an example of what a full `.env` file might look like:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
DB_NAME=mydatabase

API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=info

EMAIL_SERVER=smtp.mailtrap.io
EMAIL_PORT=2525
EMAIL_USER=my_email_user
EMAIL_PASSWORD=my_email_password
```


### Important Tips

- **Keep it Secure:** Never commit `.env` files to version control (e.g., Git) if they contain sensitive information. Use `.gitignore` to exclude them.
- **Default Values:** In your code, make sure you have default values or error handling if an environment variable is missing.

In case if we're require from a folder that contains an index.js file then we don't have to define it in the path!!!

**EVERY FOLDER IS GOING TO CONTAIN THEIR OWN INDEX.JS FILE**
A common pattern to streamline your imports and make your code cleaner

If We don't write the file name during the import statement and just end up writing The folder name it will just look for the index.js file and get the exports from this file!

## ROUTES 
In web development, routes are the paths that a web application can respond to. The terms "API-driven routes" and "normal routes" (often referred to as web routes) typically refer to different purposes and structures of these routes.

And also since we're going to have to different version of the api's!! So we need a version folder! For different Version of the api's

THIS IS API VERSIONING!

So we Need a different Folder For Routes!! WHY??

Because If we do this in the main index.js file then it will get populated for no reason!





### Normal Routes (Web Routes)

1. **Purpose**: These routes are primarily designed for rendering web pages. They often serve HTML content and are tied closely to views and user interactions in a web application.
    
2. **Example**: A typical web route might look like this:
    
    - `GET /users` — This route could return an HTML page displaying a list of users.
3. **Response**: The response is usually an HTML document that can be rendered by a web browser. It may include CSS and JavaScript for client-side interactivity.
    
4. **Frameworks**: Web frameworks like Express (Node.js), Django (Python), and Ruby on Rails often handle normal routes.
    

### API-Driven Routes

1. **Purpose**: These routes are designed to provide data and services to other applications (like mobile apps or front-end frameworks). They often serve JSON or XML responses and are typically used for communication between the server and client.
    
2. **Example**: An API-driven route might look like this:
    
    - `GET /api/users` — This route might return a JSON response with user data instead of an HTML page.
3. **Response**: The response is usually a structured data format (like JSON) that can be easily consumed by clients. It may include additional HTTP headers for caching, authentication, etc.
    
4. **Frameworks**: While traditional web frameworks can handle API routes, there are also specialized frameworks like Express.js (with a focus on APIs), Flask (Python), and FastAPI (Python) that are tailored for building APIs.
    
The `npx` command in Node.js (which comes bundled with **npm** starting from version 5.2.0) is used to **execute Node.js packages without installing them globally**.
### Key Differences

- **Response Format**: Normal routes typically return HTML, while API-driven routes return data formats like JSON.
- **Use Cases**: Normal routes are used for rendering web pages for users, while API-driven routes are used for providing data to applications and services.

## express.Router

Use the `express.Router` class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A `Router` instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.

The following example creates a router as a module, loads a middleware function in it, defines some routes, and mounts the router module on a path in the main app.

Create a router file named `birds.js` in the app directory, with the following content:


```javascript
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

// middleware that is specific to this router
const timeLog = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now())
  next()
}
router.use(timeLog)

// define the home page route
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Birds home page')
})
// define the about route
router.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About birds')
})

module.exports = router
```
Here We're exporting the Router object!


Then, load the router module in the app:

```javascript

const birds = require('./birds')

// ...

app.use('/birds', birds)
```

Here We first imported the router object then we're going to mount this router in the main app!!
Now If someone Does -> /birds or / birds/about This router will come into play!

HERE WE CAN EVEN MODULARISE ROUTING INTO SEPERATE FOLDERS THEN WE CAN DO THIS!

### What's actually happening in `app.use('/birds', birds);`?

You are telling Express:

> "Hey Express, for **any request that starts with `/birds`**, delegate it to the `birds` router to handle the rest."

So if someone makes a request to `/birds/about`, Express:

1. Sees that it starts with `/birds`
    
2. Strips off `/birds` from the path
    
3. Passes the remaining path (`/` or `/about`, etc.) to the `birds` router

![Pasted image 20250523125025.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250523125025.png)


### Why it feels weird (and how to get comfortable)

It may feel strange because:

- You're writing `/` and `/about` in `birds.js`, but they’re really mounted under `/birds`.
    
- This two-level logic (mount + internal paths) separates concerns — which is powerful, but not obvious at first.
    

Once you realize you're **mounting a sub-application** (router) at a path, it starts to click.
SANKET NE ROUTING KAFFI ACHA PADHAYA HAI!!


And app.use() Gives you the power to add middlewares on a specifc or to all paths and mount routers!

**ORM** stands for **Object-Relational Mapping**. It's a programming technique used to interact with a **relational database** (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) using the **object-oriented paradigm** of a programming language.

### In simple terms:

ORM lets you work with database records as if they were **regular objects** in your code — no need to write raw SQL queries manually.

### Why use ORM?

- **Abstraction**: You don’t need to write SQL for common operations (insert, update, delete, query).
    
- **Convenience**: It maps database tables to classes and rows to objects.
    
- **Safety**: Helps prevent SQL injection and makes code easier to read and maintain.
