In JavaScript, the `Error` class is a built-in object used to represent runtime errors. It forms the foundation for all error types in JavaScript and can be extended to create custom error types.

### Common Error Subclasses

JavaScript has several built-in subclasses of `Error`:

| Name             | When it's used                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `SyntaxError`    | Syntax is incorrect                        |
| `ReferenceError` | Reference to an undefined variable         |
| `TypeError`      | A value is not of the expected type        |
| `RangeError`     | A number is outside an allowable range     |
| `EvalError`      | An error related to the `eval()` function  |
| `URIError`       | Malformed URI passed to `decodeURI()` etc. |
| `AggregateError` | Represents multiple errors at once         |

### ✅ **Purpose of the `seeders` Folder**

The `seeders` folder contains **database seed files** — scripts that insert predefined data into your database. This is called **seeding**.

### **Use Cases of Seeders**

1. **Populate Database with Sample Data**
    
    - Useful for development and testing.
        
    - Example: Create dummy users, products, blog posts, etc.
        
2. **Initial Setup Data**
    
    - Insert required static data like roles (`admin`, `user`), categories, countries, etc.
        
3. **Demo or Testing**
    
    - Load consistent data before running automated tests or showing demos.
        
4. **Resetting Data**
    
    - In development, you can wipe the DB and re-run seeders to get a clean state.

### **How It Fits in MVC**

In MVC:

- **Model** defines the structure (`User`, `Post`, etc.).
    
- **Seeder** uses the **Model** to create actual records in the DB.
    

**Folder structure example (Node.js + Sequelize):**
