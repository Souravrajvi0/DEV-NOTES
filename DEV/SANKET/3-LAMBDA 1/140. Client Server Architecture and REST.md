Client : Any end system That Initiates a request is actually considered as a client!!
![140. Recording - Client Server Architecture and REST-20241103160454194.webp](../../Images/140.%20Recording%20-%20Client%20Server%20Architecture%20and%20REST-20241103160454194.webp)

When we say Client if doesn't mean it will have an UI!!!
Writing a JS script on Node and then querying over MONGO DB then here The client will be The Script part and the sever is of Mongo Db running on some machine can be even my local Machine!
Client Can Be anything that generates a Request
->ANY COMPUTER/HOST/PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY SENDS A REQUEST FOR DOING SOMETHING SPECIFC CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A CLIENT!
-> THE ONE WHO ACCEPTS A REQUEST IT CAN BE A PROCESS/MACHINE CAN BE CONSIERED AS A SERVER 
WHEN WE SAY WE HAVE AN AWS SERVER, THE SERVER CAN BE A PROCESS OR MAYBE A MACHINE IN THIS WAY THESE TERMS ARE VERY INTERCHANGABLE

API EK CONTRACT  JAISA SA HOTA HAI:
INPUT PATA HAI KYA LEGA 
OUTPUT BHI HAI KYA DEGA 
PROCESS MEIN YE KAREGA // THOUGH KAISE KAR RAHA HAI YE NAHI PATA 

SMJHA?
 MENU SE ORDER DIYA 
 KHANA BANA KAISE BANA YE NAHI PATA BUT YE PATA HAI KHANA BANA HAI
 AUR IN THE END KHANA BAN GAYA HAI

INPUT FIX HAI
OUTPUT FIX HAI
PROCESS KYA KAREGA FIX HAI BUT YE NAHI PATA HAI KAISE KAREGA !!
YEHI CONTRACT API HAI



SO API KYA HAI??
API ACTUALLY ENABLES US TO PROVIDE A WAY FOR OTHER PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN COMMUNCATE WITH IT AND EXCHANGE SOME DATA AND USE THE FUNCTIONALITY!!!

NETWORK CALLS LAGTI HAI AGAR DATA KAHIN AUR HAI TOH!!!
aur jabh hum browser ki api's use karte hain toh library calls lgti hain!


SINCE REACT IS A LIBRARY TOH WE DOWNLAOAD IT AND THEN USE IT'S API's!! TOH YAHAN FUNCTION CALLS LAGI HAI NAKI NETWORK CALLS!

SO WHEN SOMEONE IS TALKING ABOUT API!

THEY MUST BE TALKING ABOUT **PROPERLY DEFINED INPUT PROPERLY DEFINED OUTPUT AND PROCESSING!!!**

FRAME WORK IS LIKE BUNCH OF LIBRARIES PUT TOGETHER WHICH CAN DO A LOT OF STUFF!

The writing style of a json file is very similar to a javasacript object!
REST MEIN JSON
SOAP MEIN XML
GRPC MEIN PROTOCOL BUFFERS!

-> Here we can see there are no actions in the URL END POINTS!!

**NEVER MENTIONS ACTIONS IN THE URL** IN REST CONVENTIONS
NOUNS SHOULD BE PLURAL AS WELL

INTENDED ACTION IS DEFINED WITH THE URL AND THE HTTP MENTIONED METHOD WITH IT 

![140. Recording - Client Server Architecture and REST-20241103172509090.webp](../../Images/140.%20Recording%20-%20Client%20Server%20Architecture%20and%20REST-20241103172509090.webp)

SO IN CASE WE WANT TO SEND SENSITIVE INFORMATION IT IS NOT SENT IN THE URL BUT IN THE REQUEST BODY!

When we write like this /blogs/:id  -> signifies that part could be variable 
COLON -> :


We can include a request body with some other HTTP methods besides `POST`, but not all methods support or commonly use it. Hereâ€™s an overview:

### 1. **GET**

- **Request Body:** ðŸš« Not supported or recommended.
- GET is meant for retrieving data from a server, and the query parameters should be passed in the URL itself. Technically, you can send a body in a GET request, but most servers, proxies, and browsers ignore it as it's against the HTTP/1.1 spec.

Nesting upto level 3!

Axios and express both are libraries 

**Axios Can help you make an HTTP request**
**Express Can help you create an HTTP server that can help you accepts an HTTP Request**

**REST EXPECTS THE RESPONSE TO HAVE HTTP'S CODES!!!**

# HTTP Status Codes for REST APIs

Here are the most important HTTP status codes you should use when designing a REST API:

## Success Codes (2xx)

- **200 OK**: Standard success response for GET, PUT, PATCH or POST that doesn't create a new resource
- **201 Created**: Successful resource creation via POST or PUT
- **202 Accepted**: Request accepted but processing not completed (for async operations)
- **204 No Content**: Success but nothing to return (common for DELETE operations)

## Client Error Codes (4xx)

- **400 Bad Request**: Malformed request syntax or invalid parameters
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required and has failed or not been provided
- **403 Forbidden**: Server understood request but refuses to authorize it
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: HTTP method not allowed for the resource
- **409 Conflict**: Request conflicts with current state of the server (e.g., duplicate entry)
- **415 Unsupported Media Type**: Request payload format not supported
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Request was well-formed but contains semantic errors

## Server Error Codes (5xx)

- **500 Internal Server Error**: Generic server error
- **501 Not Implemented**: Server doesn't support the functionality required
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Server temporarily unavailable (overloaded/maintenance)

**RECIEVEING DATA CAN ONLY BE DONE IN JSON FORMAT ONLY!**

SPECIFIC API'S THAT PROVIDE ALL THESE FUNCTIONS TOGETHER ARE CALLED CRUD API'S
A **CRUD API** is an API that allows users to perform the basic **CRUD operations** on resources. CRUD stands for:

1. **C**reate
2. **R**ead
3. **U**pdate
4. **D**elete


These operations correspond to actions commonly performed on data in databases or web applications. A CRUD API typically uses RESTful design principles and HTTP methods to perform these operations.
