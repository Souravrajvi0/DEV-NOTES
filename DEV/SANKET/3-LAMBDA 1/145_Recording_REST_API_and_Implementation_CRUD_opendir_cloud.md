And sabse pehle go in the src folder and then do there
```javascript
npx sequelize init
```

You're using Sequelize CLI to **initialize a project structure** for Sequelize in your current folder.

Chlo ab database ban gaya toh ab tables bana lete hain!



### Explanation:

This command uses **Sequelize CLI** to generate a **model** and its corresponding **migration file** in a Node.js project.

### Breakdown:
THERE IS NO SPACE WHEN WE'RE MAKING THE ATTRIBUTES
- `npx`: Runs a package (in this case, `sequelize`) without installing it globally.
    
- `sequelize`: Refers to the Sequelize CLI tool.
    
- `model:generate`: Tells Sequelize to generate a new model which is analogus to tables
    
- `--name Airplane`: Specifies the name of the model to be generated (in this case, `Airplane`).
    
- `--attributes modelNumber:string,capacity:integer`: Specifies the fields/columns of the model:
    
    - `modelNumber`: A string type attribute.
        
    - `capacity`: An integer type attribute.
![Pasted image 20250524192702.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250524192702.png)


It created two files as well!
 Models folder mein airplane.js

```javascript
'use strict';

const {

  Model

} = require('sequelize');

module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {

  class Airplane extends Model {

    /**

     * Helper method for defining associations.

     * This method is not a part of Sequelize lifecycle.

     * The `models/index` file will call this method automatically.

     */

    static associate(models) {

      // define association here

    }

  }

  Airplane.init({

    modelNumber: DataTypes.STRING,

    capacity: DataTypes.INTEGER

  }, {

    sequelize,

    modelName: 'Airplane',

  });

  return Airplane;

};
```

Ye itna code mujhe nahi likhna pada khud likha gaya apne ap!!
Ye fayda hai sequelize cli ka!

![Pasted image 20250524194559.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250524194559.png)
I can edit this as well based on my needs!

But in case if we check that the table is present or not ! It won't be !! This command just created two files ! one in models folder other in migrations folder!

- This only **creates two files**:
    
    1. A **model file** (`Airplane.js`) in the `/models` folder.
        
    2. A **migration file** (`xxxx-create-airplane.js`) in the `/migrations` folder.
        

⚠️ It does **NOT create tables in your database** yet.  
It only **prepares** the instructions to create a table

It's same like git add , but we didn't do git commit
### ✅ To Actually Create Tables in the Database

You must **run the migration** using this command:

npx sequelize db:migrate

### What This Command Does:

- Looks for all migration files in your `/migrations` directory.
    
- Executes each migration that **hasn’t been run yet**.
    
- Creates tables in your database according to those migration files.
    
- Records the migration history in a table called `SequelizeMeta`

The Migration folder file looks like this!

![Pasted image 20250524195718.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250524195718.png)
If we wanna do some change! This could be a good time!

WHat sequelize tells us that there are two levels of constraints that we can put!


**Javascript level** in models file

![Pasted image 20250524200711.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250524200711.png)

**DATABASE LEVEL** in migrations file

In this when that table will be created that table will have that constraints also!

![Pasted image 20250524202304.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250524202304.png)

Here maine model number par bd constraint rakha hai but capacity par nahi rakha!


Now creating a migration and applying a migration are two different things!

![Pasted image 20250524202845.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250524202845.png)

It applies all the pending migrations!
### How does `npx sequelize db:migrate` know which migrations are **pending**?

Sequelize uses a special table in your database called:

> **`SequelizeMeta`**

---

### ✅ Here's how it works:

1. When you first run:
    
    
    
    `npx sequelize db:migrate`
    
    - Sequelize checks the `/migrations` folder for all migration files.
        
    - It also checks the `SequelizeMeta` table in your database.
        
2. The `SequelizeMeta` table stores the **filenames** of all migration files that have already been executed.
    
3. For each file in `/migrations`, Sequelize:
    
    - Compares it to what's recorded in `SequelizeMeta`.
        
    - If a file **does not exist in `SequelizeMeta`**, Sequelize considers it a **pending migration**.
        
    - It then executes that migration's `up()` method and adds the filename to `SequelizeMeta`.
        

---

### 🧠 Example:

Suppose your `/migrations` folder has:



`20240523-create-airplane.js 20240524-create-airport.js`

And the current `SequelizeMeta` table has:



`| migration                     | |------------------------------| | 20240523-create-airplane.js  |`

Then running:



`npx sequelize db:migrate`

will:

- Skip `20240523-create-airplane.js` (already applied).
    
- Run `20240524-create-airport.js` (not in `SequelizeMeta` yet).
    
- Then add `20240524-create-airport.js` to the `SequelizeMeta` table after successful execution.
    

---

### 🔄 Undoing Migrations

You can also **undo** migrations:



`npx sequelize db:migrate:undo`

This will:

- Roll back the **most recent** migration (i.e., call its `down()` function).
    
- Remove that file name from `SequelizeMeta`.
    

Or to undo all:


`npx sequelize db:migrate:undo:all`

Table chli jaegi but sequleize meta file bachegi!

Generally we try to keep our models/ Table names singular


**Convention in Sequelize** (and in many ORMs) to separate concerns between:

- **Model (singular):** Represents a **single entity** or object in your application (e.g., `User`, `Airplane`).
    
- **Table (plural):** Represents a **collection** of those entities in the database (e.g., `Users`, `Airplanes`).



### Why This Convention?

#### 1. **Clarity & Natural Semantics**

- `Airplane` model → represents **one** airplane.
    
- `Airplanes` table → stores **many** airplanes.
    

This mirrors natural language:

> “One airplane goes into the airplanes table.”

#### . **Code vs Data Separation**

- Models are **code constructs** — used in logic, APIs, and business rules.
    
- Tables are **database constructs** — used to store rows of data.
    

Keeping them clearly distinct (by naming) avoids confusion and improves readability.

Model file mein singular hi hoga

When we do a migration async up is applied and when we undo , Async down function is applied!

So models is more related to js
and Migrations is more related to tables

![Pasted image 20250524221727.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250524221727.png)

NOW WHO TALKS TO MODELS?? REPOSITRY LAYER TALKS TO THE MODEL!!
### **What is the Repository Layer?**



![Pasted image 20250526101827.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250526101827.png)

**Why do we need the repository layer if models already define the table?**

## 💡 Step 1: What Models Do

### ✨ **Models define the shape of your data.**

Imagine you're building a LEGO airplane. The **model** is the **blueprint** that says:

- What parts are needed (columns)
    
- What type each part is (text, number, etc.)
    
- How the parts fit together (relations)
![Pasted image 20250526110356.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250526110356.png)

## Step 2: So What Is Missing?

The model defines the **structure**, but **not the actions**.

Here’s the problem:

If you want to create a new airplane or get one from the database, you still need to write:

![Pasted image 20250526110429.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250526110429.png)

## 🧰 Step 3: Repository = Action Manager

### A Repository is the **"how to use the model"** part.

It’s a layer between:

- 🔢 **Model** (knows the data shape)
    
- 🎮 **Service or Controller** (knows what user wants)
    

The **repository** handles:

- Creating
    
- Finding
    
- Deleting
    
- Updating
![Pasted image 20250527122344.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250527122344.png)
![Pasted image 20250526110752.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250526110752.png)
## 📦 Think of It Like This:

| Part of App    | What it does                    | Real-Life Analogy                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**      | Defines the table (structure)   | Blueprint for building a house                 |
| **Repository** | Talks to the DB using the model | Builder who reads the blueprint and constructs |
| **Service**    | Contains business rules         | Project manager telling builder what to do     |
| **Controller** | Responds to the user            | Receptionist who talks to the customer         |
## 🧁 So Why Do We Need the Repository?

### 🔁 Reusability

You don’t want to write the same `.create()` or `.findByPk()` again and again.

### 🧹 Clean Code

Controller and service don’t need to worry about database code.

### 🧪 Easy Testing

You can test your repository functions without starting your whole app.

## ✅ Final Answer (Simple)

> **Models = what the data looks like.**  
> **Repositories = how we interact with that data.**  
> We use the repository layer so our code is clean, reusable, and easier to manage.


## What Are Operators in Sequelize?

Operators in Sequelize help you build **more advanced WHERE conditions** — like:

- Find users **older than 18**
    
- Find flights with **price between 500 and 1000**
    
- Get all planes with **model NOT A320**
    

They're basically **commands for comparing/filtering** your data


![Pasted image 20250526112755.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250526112755.png)


## 🔥 Most Common Operators

      [Op.lt]: 10,                             // < 10
      [Op.lte]: 10,                            // <= 10
      [Op.between]: [6, 10],                   // BETWEEN 6 AND 10
      [Op.notBetween]: [11, 15],               // NOT BETWEEN 11 AND 15

      // Other operators

      [Op.all]: sequelize.literal('SELECT 1'), // > ALL (SELECT 1)

      [Op.in]: [1, 2],                         // IN [1, 2]

      [Op.substring]: 'hat',                   // LIKE '%hat%'
      [Op.iLike]: '%hat',                      // ILIKE '%hat' (case insensitive) (PG only)
      [Op.notILike]: '%hat',                   // NOT ILIKE '%hat'  (PG only)
      [Op.regexp]: '^[h|a|t]',                 // REGEXP/~ '^[h|a|t]' (MySQL/PG only)
      [Op.notRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]',              // NOT REGEXP/!~ '^[h|a|t]' (MySQL/PG only)
      [Op.iRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]',                // ~* '^[h|a|t]' (PG only)
      [Op.notIRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]',             // !~* '^[h|a|t]' (PG only)

      [Op.any]: [2, 3],                        // ANY (ARRAY[2, 3]::INTEGER[]) (PG only)
      [Op.match]: Sequelize.fn('to_tsquery', 'fat & rat') // match text search for strings 'fat' and 'rat' (PG only)

      // In Postgres, Op.like/Op.iLike/Op.notLike can be combined to Op.any:
      [Op.like]: { [Op.any]: ['cat', 'hat'] }  // LIKE ANY (ARRAY['cat', 'hat'])

      // There are more postgres-only range operators, see below
    }
  }
});



So Anything related to queries will go in the repositry folder!

![Pasted image 20250526114940.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250526114940.png)

### 1. **`this.model.create(data)`**

This is a method provided by **Sequelize** (an ORM that lets you interact with a SQL database using JavaScript objects).

- `this.model` refers to a **Sequelize model** that was passed into the repository. For example, it could be a `User` model or a `Flight` model.
    
- `.create(data)` is a Sequelize function that:
    
    - **Creates a new row** in the database
        
    - **Uses the data** provided in the `data` object
        
    - **Automatically adds timestamps** (like createdAt, updatedAt) if your model has them
        

> For example, if `data` is:

js

CopyEdit

`{ name: 'Sourav', age: 25 }`

Then this line will create a new row in the database like:

|id|name|age|createdAt|updatedAt|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Sourav|25|2025-05-27 12:34:00|2025-05-27 12:34:00|

---

### 🕒 2. **`await`**

- Database operations take time.
    
- `await` pauses this line until the data is actually written to the database.
    
- Without `await`, the program would continue running without waiting — which would break things.
    

---

### 🧠 3. **`const response =`**

This saves the result of the `.create(data)` call into the `response` variable.

- `response` will contain the newly created row **as a JavaScript object**, including things like `id`, `createdAt`, and other model properties.


CONTROLLER PASS ON THE CALL TO SERVICE! AND SERVICES USE REPOSITRIES TO INTERACT WITH THE DATABASE!!!


-----
How to use Service layer code--

## 💼 Scenario: Create an Airplane

We want a function in the service layer that:

- Receives data like `{ modelNumber: "Boeing 747", capacity: 400 }`
    
- Validates or processes it (you can add logic here later)
    
- Passes it to the repository to store in the DB
    
- Returns the created record
    

---

### ✅ Service Layer Code (📁 `services/airplane-service.js`)

```javascript
const { AirplaneRepository } = require('../repositories'); // Step 1: Import repo

// Airplane repositry ne ek class export ki thi uska hi object bana rahe hain hum!
// Step 2: Create a repo object to use its methods
const airplaneRepository = new AirplaneRepository();

// Step 3: Create service function
async function createAirplane(data) {
    try {
        // Call repository to save the airplane
        const airplane = await airplaneRepository.create(data);

        // You could add business logic here (e.g. check capacity, etc)

        return airplane;
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle or log error if needed
        console.error("Something went wrong in the service layer");
        throw error;
    }
}

// Step 4: Export function so it can be used in controller
module.exports = {
    createAirplane
};

```
---

## 🧠 How this service is used:

### 🧭 Controller Layer (Just for context)

```javascript
const { createAirplane } = require('../services/airplane-service');

async function handleCreateAirplane(req, res) {
    try {
        const airplane = await createAirplane(req.body);
        res.status(201).json({
            success: true,
            data: airplane,
        });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({
            success: false,
            message: 'Something went wrong!',
        });
    }
}
```
---

## 🛠️ Repository Layer (Example structure)

Your `AirplaneRepository` might extend a generic CRUD class like:


```javascript
class AirplaneRepository extends CrudRepository {
    constructor() {
        super(Airplane); // Airplane is the model (Sequelize)
    }
}
```
---

## ✅ Summary:

|Layer|Role|
|---|---|
|**Model**|Table definition (`Airplane`)|
|**Repository**|Direct DB access using Sequelize|
|**Service**|Logic and rules for creating airplane|

This Lecture is pretty fuckin cool
### **What is `express.json()`?**

`express.json()` is a **built-in middleware function** in Express.

It tells your app:

> "Hey! When a request comes in with JSON data (usually in the body), please **parse** it and give it to me as a JavaScript object.

### Why `app.use(express.json())`?

Because when you send data from the frontend (like a POST request with `{ name: "Sourav" }`), Express **by default doesn't know how to read that body**.

So if you don’t use `express.json()`, then:

![Pasted image 20250527161050.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250527161050.png)
![Pasted image 20250527161257.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250527161257.png)![Pasted image 20250529151203.png](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020250529151203.png)

**es, you can change (or transform) the response object at any layer** — especially in the **service layer**, which is the best place to apply **business logic or transformation**.

---

### 🧠 WHY would you change the response?

Because sometimes:

- You want to **hide some fields** (e.g., `updatedAt`)
    
- You want to **rename fields** (e.g., from `modelNumber` → `model`)
    
- You want to **add computed values** (e.g., `isLargeAirplane: true`)
    
- Or apply some kind of **business logic** before sending it up
    

---

### 🔧 WHERE to change it?

| Layer          | Best For Changing Data? | Reason                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Repository** | ❌ Not ideal             | Should stick to pure DB operations                     |
| **Service**    | ✅ Yes!                  | Ideal for business rules, logic, transformation        |
| **Controller** | ✅ Sometimes             | For formatting responses or adding HTTP-specific logic |
### Summary

Yes, **you can and often should modify the response** in the service layer if:

- You want to apply logic
    
- You need to shape the data for the client
    
- You want to hide internal DB fields
