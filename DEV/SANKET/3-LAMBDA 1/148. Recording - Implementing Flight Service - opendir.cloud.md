FLIGHT SEARCH SERVICE PAR AB HUM KARENGE!!

FIRST THINK OF DESIGN OF THE DATABASE!!

FLIGHT:
DELHI -> BOMBAY!

PLANES CAN BE USED IN MULTIPLE FLIGHTS!!
AN AIRPLANE CAN BELONG TO MULTIPLE FLIGHTS!

WE NEED DEPARTURE CITY! ARRIVAL CITY!
ARRIVAL TIME AND DEPARTURE TIME

PRICE 
BOARDING GATE!
TOTAL NUMBER OF SEATS!

IN ONE CITY YOU CAN HAVE MULTILPE AIRPORTS! SO DEPARTURE AND ARRIVAL AIRPORTS WOULD BE A BETTER OPTION

### üß† Notes:

- Since an **airplane can belong to multiple flights**, the relationship is **one-to-many**: `airplane` ‚Üí `flight`.
    
- Similarly, an **airport belongs to a city**, but **a city can have multiple airports**: `city` ‚Üí `airport`.
    
- You have rightly modeled **departure and arrival as airport IDs**, not city names ‚Äî this is more accurate and scalable.
