We're going to make chat application

Now here we'll have communication 


## What are Socket.IO Rooms?

**Rooms** are arbitrary channels that sockets (client connections) can join and leave, allowing you to broadcast events to specific subsets of connected clients rather than all users[](https://socket.io/docs/v3/rooms/). Think of rooms as virtual chat rooms or channels where related users can communicate.


## Key Concepts

## Room Functionality

- **Arbitrary channels**: Rooms are flexible groupings that can be created for any purpose[](https://socket.io/docs/v2/rooms/)
    
- **Server-side control**: Rooms can only be joined and managed from the server side, not by clients directly[](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/socket.io_rooms.htm)
    
- **Automatic creation**: When a socket joins a non-existent room, it's created automatically[](https://dev.to/wpreble1/socket-io-namespaces-and-rooms-d5h)
    
- **Auto-cleanup**: When the last socket leaves a room, the room is destroyed automatically
